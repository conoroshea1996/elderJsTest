### **What is GDPR?**

In 2016, the European Commission approved and adopted the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is a major change in data protection regulation in the EU and replaces the existing legal framework (the Data Protection Directive and the various member state laws). GDPR came into effect on May 25, 2018.

### **Why is GDPR important?**

GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' data that they process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. We are following the developments about GDPR and are taking steps to prepare for compliance.

### **What is HireHive doing to comply with GDPR?**

We have implemented changes throughout the organisation to ensure that we remain fully compliant with all European Data Protection Regulation.

Our compliance, data protection, and information security teams have prepared our services for GDPR. We reviewed our data processing activities to ensure full compliance with GDPR.

### **Here are some ways HireHive is enabling customers to become GDPR ready:**

**Transparency into information use.**  
The GDPR will likely require organizations provide more information about how individuals’ information is used.

**How HireHive enables transparency.**  
Here at HireHive, transparency is a vital part of our overall business process. HireHive is designed to provide customers with full control of their content and ways to access it.

**Clear Privacy Policy**  
HireHive's Privacy Policy is clearly communicated in reader-friendly language. This document describes HireHive's processes around data collection and processing, in addition to your rights around such data. Under HireHive’s Privacy Policy, customers can also easily communicate with our data security teams directly regarding their data and other privacy-related issues.

**Access controls.**  
HireHive is designed in a way that company account administrators have the ability to grant or rescind access to their HireHive account through the 'Hiring Team' dashboard. This means customers are the ones that control who can access the account.

**Product release communication.**  
Feature changes and product releases are communicated to customers through regular release notes via Intercom on the company dashboard. Customers receive the most up-to-date information in a clear and easily accessible way.

**Visibility into processing.**  
Under the GDPR, individuals can access a copy of their data and know where their data is being processed.

How HireHive enables processing visibility:

- Effortless downloads. All data can be easily downloaded for full access.
- Right to be forgotten. Individuals can ask to delete their personal data.

### **How can HireHive further assist in your GDPR compliance efforts?**
