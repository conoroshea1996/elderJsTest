1. This is for HireHive paid account holders only.
2. You can refer HireHive to as many people as you like – there’s no limit.
3. You can’t refer yourself, sorry!
4. Referred users can start referring others as soon as they have a paid account.

### Rewards

1. A $250 Amazon gift card (or equivalent for local currency and geographically local Amazon online store), will be awarded if the referred company or person signs up for a paid subscription.
2. This voucher will only be given following a period of six months, on a paid subscription (any plan).

### Important stuff

A referred company or person must create an account using the unique referral link, which is sent through the invite email. If this unique link isn't used, the reward and offer is void. This is the only way for us to track genuine referrals.

This may not happen often but if it does, HireHive will reflect the changes.

**A referred company or person or account holder has questions?**
