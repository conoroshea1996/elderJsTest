You’ve probably heard of recruiting software and you’ve probably seen them in action, but you may have asked, why change?

Well, they make every step of recruitment, from advertising right through to welcoming your hire into the company, effortless. Here are a few more reasons you might want to consider using recruiting software.

> On average only 35% of applicants have the skills or experience required by a role, so using keywords to select candidates is crucial.

#### Sourcing

One of the obvious benefits of using recruiting software is it gives a recruitment team a starting point. So you’re in the middle of a time of aggressive recruitment and you don’t even know where to even begin? Well here’s your diving board. From operations central, you’re able to get job postings out to multiple jobs boards at once.

Recruitment software also offers insight into how candidates are finding you and which mediums of advertising are offering the best ROI. HireHive even offers a means of monitoring referrals from employees, so literally any avenue for applicants is covered.

#### Screening

The prospect of whittling down all your applicants to the best of the bunch can be a daunting task, so for this reason recruiting software could be your new best friend. On average only [35% of applicants have the skills or experience required by a role](https://www.cebglobal.com/blogs/volume-recruitment-3-steps-to-improve-your-hiring-process/), so using keywords to select candidates is really crucial.

Matching applications with the job description you have set out will sift out the best quality candidates from bad. No leafing through stacks of CVs, trying to find the most relevant candidates, letting you get down to the nitty gritty of the job of recruiting… quickly.

#### Tracking

Recruiting software is basically mission control for recruitment. You’ll find yourself channeling Captain Kirk at the helm of the USS Enterprise as you review incoming applications, progress reports, data on applicants, all from one cloud-based solution.

Greater [data-insights can help to improve candidate experience](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2015/02/the-6-recruiting-metrics-that-really-matter) and even after a successful hire, you’ve got a wealth of data collected, boosting your recruitment strategy. Your recruitment team benefits from a set, streamlined workflow, keeping everyone on the same page. HireHive even offers the option to vary access rights. It takes a whole Starfleet crew recruitment team to hire the right candidate, so ATS offers the best way of keeping everyone in the loop.

#### Communication

One of the anxieties in automating this part of the recruitment process is that it takes the human out of HR - that couldn’t be more untrue! Using recruitment software offers a greater level of communication that’s not just a one way street. Evidence shows that poor communication is frustrating and off-putting for candidates, with those who have had a bad recruiting experience [38% less likely to stay in the role](https://www.cebglobal.com/blogs/volume-recruitment-why-unhappy-candidates-mean-less-revenue/).

Candidate experience is key to recruitment and employee retention, so being able to maintain meaningful contact with candidates is key. A candidate may not be successful this time around, but you never know when the perfect role may turn up for them.

To make sure your applicants are getting the best experience and you’re getting the most qualified recruits, automation may be the way to go. Applicant tracking systems could be the quickest, most effective way to turn a pile of CVs into a happy new hire.
