_We are in the midst of the peak recruiting season. What will edge you ahead of the competition? It may well be your recruiting software._

September is the busiest time of the year for most recruiters. There might be need to hurtle through the usual process of advertising, interviewing and making an offer at lightening speed, but a little planning, along with the help of your recruiting software solution, can help you overcome this.

The trick to making effective hires during the peak recruiting season is introducing efficiencies wherever you can. Every step in the recruiting process has corners that you need to cut off. Here are a few tips on how you might do that ahead of the annual recruiting peak:

#### **Have advertisements ready to go**

Formulating an effective and succinct advertisement offers a significant challenge to recruiters. You might have a high-level understanding of what is required of a candidate in a particular role, but it can be hard to [distill down](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/9-steps-to-writing-job-ads-top-candidates-cant-resist.html) the essence of the perfect candidate into a 200-word ad.

> If you expect to be hiring in a particular area in September, you can put together job specifications

It is a really good idea to prepare templates or even advertisements ahead of time. There are general qualities that your employees will require, which you include in all ads, which you can have a template prepared for. If you expect to be hiring in a particular area in September, you can put together job specifications.

#### **Refer to your existing talent pool or network**

It is very likely that you have had contact with candidates that were shortlisted and that you felt were a good fit, but were not successful in that particular recruiting project. It is also very likely that you have had contact with desirable passive candidates through social media platforms like LinkedIn.

This legwork building your [talent pool](https://www.socialtalent.co/blog/3-quick-tricks-fill-talent-pool) that you have already done may be very useful during peaks of hiring. You may already have a shortlist of suitable interviewees ready to go and you may well have the necessary screening done already.

#### **Scheduling**

Time is unlikely to be on your side during the peak of recruiting in September. There will be an expectation to advertise, screen, interview, recruit and onboard within just a few weeks. Not only do you have to make time for this yourself, but the recruiting manager and other important team members will have to be included in the process.

The solution here may be block booking of time with those who need to be involved in the recruiting project. Recruiting software like HireHive has interview [scheduling tools](https://hirehive.com/recruiting-features/interview-scheduling/), which work with Google and Outlook. You can invite several colleagues at once, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
