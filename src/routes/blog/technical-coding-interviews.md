_Skype interviews might not seem like the most intuitive way of conducting coding interviews, but how can they benefit your recruiting process?_

The competition for top quality technical talent is pretty intense, so including a coding test in your recruiting process is essential to ensure you are getting the kind of candidates you need. Sometimes getting a candidate onsite can be tough, so what alternatives are there?

[Skype recently added a feature](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/skypes-new-interviews-feature-lets-you-test-candidates-using-a-real-time-code-editor/) where during a video chat a candidate can live-code in a separate window, so they can demonstrate their skills in real time. In light of that, how can video chat improve your interviewing and screening of technical candidates?

> Whiteboard coding interviews are a great way of getting a candidate to show off their skills and to get them to explain their choices in detail

#### **Real-time coding window**

Whiteboard coding interviews are a great way of getting a candidate to show off their skills and to get them to explain their choices in detail. If they can demonstrate skills onsite - that is great, but that is not always possible.

Skype are introducing a new real-time coding window feature that allows you to simultaneously have a video chat open, as well as a real-time coding window that your candidate can work in. This is the next best thing to having them in the office with you.

#### **Feedback**

[Candidate experience](https://hirehive.com/good-candidate-experience-secret-happy-hire/) can colour public perception of your organisation and the impact of this cannot be underestimated. Word of mouth is very effective and if your candidate shares a bad experience, that story can spread quickly. By offering feedback, you offer candidates something for their time and effort.

A live coding interview offers the opportunity to offer concrete feedback on their performance and skills. A code sample gives you something that you can engage with and discuss with the candidate. Once handled sensitively, you can even give real-time feedback.

> A live coding interview allows you to assess the verbal and communication skills of the candidate

#### **Get them talking**

When hiring for a technical role, the technical skills of the candidate are obviously front and center, but that alone is not enough to ensure that they will integrate with the existing team or to ensure that they will be able to communicate with their colleagues.

A live coding interview allows you to assess the verbal and communication skills of the candidate. In this environment, candidates can qualify their decision to include a certain element, which can also help them to demonstrate other areas of technical knowledge.

#### **Screening**

Opportunities to chat with candidates or meet face-to-face areÂ scarce during the recruiting process. This engagement is the simplest way of getting a feel for your candidate, as well as how they work.

Video is like a combination of face-to-face and phone interaction, which offers ample opportunity to learn more about your candidate. This extra level of screening will help you to make the right [cultural match](https://hirehive.com/should-your-company-culture-change-your-approach-to-recruiting/) for your existing team.
