HireHive has been shortlisted for the [HR Leadership & Management Awards 2019](https://www.hrawards.ie/)! For the second year in a row, we have been nominated in the HR Supplier of the Year category.

A few months ago, we decided to apply again for the 2019’s edition of the HR Awards. We had a lot of fun at the ceremony last year but unfortunately, we didn't win the award...so fingers crossed for this year! We've decided to share a few items from our entry with you,  to give you an insight into what happened in the Hive in 2018. Let's start with a few numbers:

Our first big project of 2018 was of course GDPR. If you read our blog often, you’re probably tired of reading our articles on the topic. It was indeed a big part of our year 2018, as we had to consult extensively with legal professionals. We spent months creating new tools to help our customers be compliant with their recruitment data. You can read our post on how HireHive helps customers become GDPR compliant [here](https://hirehive.com/how-is-hirehive-helping-customers-become-gdpr-ready/) and you can learn more about the HireHive GDPR compliance features in [this article](https://hirehive.com/gdpr-compliance-features-hirehive/).

Employer branding was also one of our projects in 2018, which is why we created the [HireHive jobs API](https://hirehive.com/hirehive-api-new-job-integration-option/). Our API allows our customers to have complete control over how their jobs are displayed on their website. This allows them to create a careers site that completely fits in with their employer branding. That was a really important project for HireHive as employer branding is something essential for us.

Our other huge project in 2018 was to decide how HireHive was going to evolve. This lead to one of the biggest decisions we've had to make so far: HireHive is going to become a fully multilingual ATS! We already offer application forms in 9 different languages, but we’ve now decided to go even further and to translate the entire tool. This is a big step for us, as it requires months of development from our engineers to be able to do this. It also represents a massive challenge for the whole team, but we're super excited about this new project. Stay tuned, we will be talking more about this soon!

The HR Leadership and Management Awards have been held in Ireland since 2014. They celebrate excellence in Human Resources and among the great companies shortlisted in the different categories, are:
