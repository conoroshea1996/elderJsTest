Interview feedback is considered a very important aspect of the interviewing process, which means it cannot be overlooked by the recruiter. It will ultimately impact how your company is perceived and what kind of culture you are understood to have. If you want your organisation to be accurately represented to candidates and the wider public, consider carefully how you deal with unsuccessful candidates.

It might be difficult to know what information a candidate is looking for or indeed what detail is required. Which medium would be best suited to deliver this information? Which tools can help with this? When should feedback be given to an unsuccessful candidate?

#### What candidates want to know?

Candidates want to learn from the experience and if they are serious about working for your organisation, they will want to know what you are seeking in a candidate. They will want a good level of detail in any feedback, so that they fully understand what they may have lacked.

> For the recruiter, it is very important to provide helpful and constructive feedback

For the recruiter, it is very important to provide helpful and constructive feedback. Keep on topic and do not focus on the negative too much. It's also a good idea to end on a positive note about the candidate’s application and interview.

#### How to formulate your feedback

What is important here is keeping focus directed on the skills and experience required for the job. Keep it directly associated with the job advertisement. Use the job criteria as a reference. Provide examples and give them feedback on any assessments included in the application. Might just be that there were candidates with that bit more experience.

#### ATS accommodates improved communications

Utilising a handful of tools can help greatly with this aspect of the recruiting process. A two-way means of communication will offer the candidate and recruiter the possibility of following up on an application. This two-way communication is easily facilitated using recruiting software. Email is a very effective means of offering feedback, but a call can add a personal touch.

#### Timing

Let them know fairly quickly after the interview or application. Leaving a candidate waiting can instil false hope or send the wrong signals to the applicants. This can pose a challenge to the recruiter, who may have a number of other tasks to attend to, including onboarding new hires. Taking the time to give feedback shortly after the interviewing process will have a very positive impact on public perception. What about future opportunities? Be fully transparent - if there is a slim likelihood of similar roles coming up or you feel they are not suited, don’t give false hope. Honesty is the best policy here.
