So how important is company culture? You should not be asking that question. It is critical. With the high competition for talent, company culture may be your best chance to win and retain top talent. Your retention rates are going to be directly impacted by your culture. If your organisation is not what it claims to be, you will have a tough time holding onto hires.

If your retention rates are not high, it raises questions about both your organisational culture and your recruiting strategy. At the heart of all of this, are your organisation's HR and managerial teams. What is important to emphasise about company culture in your recruiting and HR management efforts?

Your careers page is a pretty important aspect of the recruiting process. It will likely be the place candidates will look for information about your organization or for roles at your company.

Your careers page can be an excellent resource for employee testimonials, or for information on [employee benefits](http://hirehive.io/blog/candidate-appreciation-good-perks-will-win-top-candidates/).

If this information is clear and extensive, finding a candidate who is a good culture match will be easier. Using recruiting software, you can easily generate a careers page for your recruiting efforts. Whatever your company culture may be, make it clear, as your way of doing things will greatly appeal to a discerning candidate.

#### **Reinforce**

If your company has taken a stand in a certain area, whether that be a charitable campaign or a policy of free snacks, you need to reinforce this at any opportunity. If your organization has placed some core belief as a foundation for all policy, make it clearly known. This is what will set you apart from the competition in recruiting and HR management.

A sense of your culture should be immediately obvious to anyone who engages with your organization. If it feels forced or disingenuous, it will be immediately obvious to your employees or candidates, which could raise issues around recruiting and retention.
