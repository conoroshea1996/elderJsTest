We can often impress ourselves with our Internet stalking skills. Have you managed to find an ex-boyfriend’s MySpace page from 2005? Found your sister’s teenage LiveJournal to mock her mercilessly? Found your new colleague's LinkedIn page under her maiden name?

With the wealth of social media tools at our disposal, it can sometimes be a little too easy to get any information you are looking for, on any individual. While there is a funny side to this, there is also a pretty useful side to it too.

> When trying to reach the candidates you are interested in, it can be difficult to reach them directly

When trying to reach the candidates you are interested in, it can be difficult to reach them directly. Not everybody checks their LinkedIn every day, nor their other social media platforms. Email offers the most direct route, but not everyone advertises it online. How do you get someone's email, without having it handed to you?

> #### **Discoverly Chrome extension**

This [Chrome extension](http://discover.ly/) aggregates information from an individual's various social media accounts. You can determine if you have friends or followers in common, across various platforms.

You can also establish their email, by entering various combinations, which the tool will then auto-populate. Using the combinations of resources available, you get the information you need. What's more, this tool is free.

#### **Clearbit Connect Chrome extension**

This is another interesting [Chrome Extension](https://connect.clearbit.com/). In this case, the tool works with Gmail to help you establish a user's email address. By entering an individual's company and name, it will auto-populate with various options.

The tool will offer information on an individual's role in an organisation. This tool is free, with premium options available from Clearbit Connect, but it only works with Gmail.

#### **Voila Norbert**

[Voila Norbert](https://www.voilanorbert.com/) is another cool tool that helps you to find an email address, with just a name and company domain. Simply search those details in Voila Norbert and it returns an email, by pinging the company’s server. Pretty handy.

Voila Norbert is free to a certain search limit, with price plans available to users if necessary.

#### **Email Hunter**

This tool is again pretty easy to use. [Email Hunter](https://hunter.io/) simply requires you to enter a company domain and it will provide you with a list of emails it found online. Not only that, but it will verify any emails it finds for you.

Again, this is a free tool to use, up to 150 searches per month. After that there are various pricing options. This one is also available as a - you will never guess - a Chrome extension.

> #### **The old fashioned way**

If you have found them on social media, there is no harm in simply reaching out and asking for an email address. There are some who may be cagey about engaging with someone who they did not give their email address to, so you may as well just ask.

Another good way is trying for a portfolio site. They may not be advertising their email address, but they may have a contact form or they may have provided their email address in a format other than a link.
