_A reliable recruiting process always cuts a task in half… except for the creative process. That is painfully slow. A good recruiting software solution helps too._

Working out a few key processes can work wonders on your ability to reach your workplace goals. Coupled with recruiting software, you can upgrade the way you hire and make use of your past recruiting data.

By making your processes as efficient as possible, you can get a lot more work done, with minimal effort. By ensuring your processes cover various aspects and meet various needs, you can streamline your processes to military precision.

#### **Always be hiring**

It is a good idea to keep recruiting efforts tipping along, rather than hiring in fits and starts, as vacancies come up. Recruiting is done best when you commit the time needed to the project, so doing a little bit regularly makes reaching your recruiting goals much easier.

Constantly go through CVs that candidates submitted and build up a pool of talented candidates. Making contacts all the time will help with difficult-to-fill posts.

#### **Parting is such sweet sorrow**

How you part with any of your candidates makes a huge impact on your future recruiting efforts. By having some of the leg work done already, you can re-use past recruiting efforts to fill additional roles.

By giving a candidate plenty of constructive feedback and keeping up a reasonable level of communications throughout the recruiting process, you will ensure that both parties part on good terms.

#### **Screen queens**

The screening aspect of your recruiting process is essential if you want to find the candidate with the right skills set and the right attitude. Going through CVs and applications effectively will be good for you in the long term, giving you a detailed record of your candidates.

By including tests or specific questions in the application process, you will efficiently eliminate unsuitable candidates, allowing you to go further in the process with the candidates with the right experience.

#### **Know what you want**

There is nothing wrong with high standards. At the outset of your recruiting campaign, make a clear list of requirements from your potential new hires. By knowing exactly what you need, you waste very little time or effort on unsuitable candidates.

It is a good idea to make out a short list of need-to-haves and a slightly longer list of nice-to-haves, which you can use as criteria when going through applications. It is much easier to be decisive, when you know exactly what you need from new hires.

#### **Interviewing**

This is one of your only opportunities to weigh up your candidates face-to-face, so do not waste this valuable opportunity in your recruiting process. Not only will it give you greater insight on your candidates, but it will give you a chance to demonstrate your company culture - [candidate experience](http://hirehive.io/blog/candidate-experience-successful-hire/) is key.

You should use a consistent core structure for each interviewee, so that there is a truly level playing field. You should also work out a structure in advance, deciding the line of questioning and interviewing panel ahead of time.
