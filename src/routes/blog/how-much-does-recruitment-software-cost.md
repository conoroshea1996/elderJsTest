If you have ever been looking to implement an ATS, one of your first questions probably was "how much does recruitment software cost?".

Well, recruitment software can cost anything from free (almost always with a catch) to seven figures. Some recruitment software companies won’t publish their pricing which feels a bit like “if you have to ask you can’t afford it”.

Here’s a brief summary based on what’s available in the public domain;

### [

HireHive](https://hirehive.com/) - $49 per month for three jobs

Completely transparent pricing with packages of 3 open roles for small companies starting at only $49 per month. Sure, we have a vested interest but we honestly believe this is the best value recruitment software on the market.

### [

Workable](https://www.workable.com/) - $99 per month for one job

Nice software that starts at $99 per month for one job.

### [

SmartRecruiters](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/) - $10,000 per year

The website advertises their core product starting at $10,000 per year.

### [

Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.io/) - Undisclosed

Crunchbase reports that Greenhouse has raised over $110m in venture funding. VCs will want their money back out and that can only come from getting customers to chump up as much as possible. Pricing depends on the size of your company but you can expect most customers to be paying way over $10k per year.

### [

Jobvite](https://www.jobvite.com/) - Undisclosed

Jobvite was the first of ATS 2.0 players and had a nice product compared to what was available at the time. Other providers have caught up but Jobvite still remains a popular choice for large companies. They don’t publish their pricing but according to [ongig.com](http://ongig.com/) “Jobvite pricing ranges from around $4,000 per year (26 to 50 employees) to $100,000 per year (2,501 to 5,000 employees)”.

### [

Lever](https://www.lever.co/) - Undisclosed

Lever is a very nicely designed piece of software with a top shelf price. A recent blog post mentions annual costs of up to $125,000 per year. If budget is no problem then Lever is actually a great option.
