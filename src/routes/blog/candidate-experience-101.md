No matter how long you have to recruit, no matter what tools you have, the most significant thing for your candidates is their experience with your organisation. If the recruiting process has not inspired confidence, a candidate will be reluctant to take up any offer you put forward.

[Ensuring good candidate experience](http://hirehive.io/blog/good-candidate-experience-secret-happy-hire/) means a lot to the profile of your organisation and public perception and it does not require much effort, especially when you use recruiting software. Here are a few things to consider when recruiting to make sure your candidates are having a positive recruiting experience.

#### **Communication**

Everyone’s favourite recruiting statistic? Up to [70% of candidate](http://hirehive.io/blog/candidate-experience-successful-hire/)s don’t even get an automated response when applying for jobs. Therefore, a candidate feels uncertain that their application was received.

> By formulating some kind of response, even an automated one, you immediately place your organisation above the competition

By formulating some kind of response, even an automated one, you immediately place your organisation above the competition. Yes, it is that easy.

#### **Ease of use**

There is nothing worse than having to enter your address twice when placing an order online, or repeatedly getting errors because you missed a field with an asterisk. Applying for jobs online throws out some similar challenges.

> By streamlining certain aspects of the process, you can make life much easier on the candidate

By streamlining certain aspects of the process, you can make life much easier on the candidate. Allow them to upload a CV, rather than filling out each job they have held in the past five years. An online [recruiting software](http://hirehive.io/blog/recruiting-software-help-better-hires/) solution like HireHive is ideal, as it lets you customise the application process, minimising the information needed.

#### **Timing**

Nobody likes waiting. By getting in contact with candidates swiftly, you are more likely to keep their interest. It is no good contacting a candidate weeks or even months after an application. They are likely to have taken up another position in that time.

Even sending a quick email to say that you are still in the decision making progress will make the candidate feel better.

#### **Personalisation**

We all like a little bit of special treatment. I even get a buzz if the barista remembers I like cinnamon on a cappuccino. It does not take a lot of effort, but it can make a huge difference in the long run.

By setting up your automated correspondence to address a candidate by name, the candidate feels like they are interacting with a human being, rather than just filtered through a machine.

#### **Feedback**

Though time constraints to hire can pose a challenge here, it is important to try and give feedback to applicants. When you have interviews to arrange and onboarding to organise, it can be tough to find the time, but taking a moment to offer feedback means an awful lot to candidates.

If you are interested in the candidate and think that there might be an opportunity with your organisation for them in future, it is good to part on good terms.
