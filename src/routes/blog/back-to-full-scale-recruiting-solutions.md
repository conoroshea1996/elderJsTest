It’s approaching the busiest time of the year. You may say you’re always up the walls, but seriously, this is the busiest time of the year for recruiting. Graduate recruiting is beginning, you’re into the the last quarter of the year, so projects need to be finished and budget is being freed up.

The peak number of searches by candidates for new roles is September (with October and November following closely), so candidates are looking for you and of course, you want to find them. In some cases, it’s seasonal work for the holiday season, so candidates need to be found quickly.

All of this may be approaching, but recruiting has scaled down for the past three months. Key decision makers are just back in the office and key plans are unlikely to be set in place. No big deal. It’s not like you needed that time to shower or see your family or anything.

Here’s how to get the cogs turning again and get back into full-scale recruiting.

#### Screening

Screening can be enormously time consuming and if you’ve barely got time to think, you’ll need to work out an effective, efficient process or strategy. Take the time to work out a clear-cut profile of the candidate you need. Make a concise list of criteria, focusing on the necessary skills and experience.

Having exact criteria will help you to eliminate unsuitable candidates early on. With this efficiency and a good level of communication, you’ll be able to ensure an improved candidate experience for applicants, whether they’re successful or not.

#### Planning

A flexible, comprehensive plan is essential. Things rarely go to plan, so that is where the flexibility part comes in. You also need to set yourself realistic targets. Putting the time in early on here can help the whole process tick along. If you set goals and timelines, it becomes much clearer what you need to achieve and when.

Take the time to go through data you have already and look at the results of previous recruiting campaigns. There is a lot to be learned from your past successes and mistakes, which help you greatly where there’s a big turnover of work expected. Any data gathered or reports pulled from your online recruiting software makes the job much easier here.

#### Pick a team

Rather than have yourself or your whole team pulled in 10 different directions, to get the necessary candidates hired, pick a dedicated team to focus on the job of recruitment. It is much easier to do one job at a time, so focussing energies onto one project or task will improve efficiency and throughput.

This also ensures that your mainstream HR team is able to focus of the upcoming task of onboarding and bringing new employees into the organisation. A small dedicated recruiting team, with a full understanding of the timeline and requirements will vastly improve productivity.
