We work hard at HireHive to take user feedback and testing into account as we continually develop our software. All customer feedback is reviewed by the team and 'user friendliness' is not just a buzz word but something we are passionate about perfecting. There are almost 300 Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) solutions listed on Capterra, so being named to the Top 20 is a great achievement.
