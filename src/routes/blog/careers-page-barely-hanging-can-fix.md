Career sites are rarely pretty and rarely functional. We've all had the frustration of having to fill out our job history, despite having uploaded a CV. We've also pressed submit on an application, only to be left wondering if the application was received or successful.

> If your careers site is not mobile optimised, you run a serious risk of deterring or losing candidates.

Your careers page should not look like this and you need to address this problem. If you want change, you have to be the change. Here's a quick to-do list on how to change your careers page for the better.

#### **Make your Careers Page Mobile Friendly**

Mobile Internet use has surpassed desktop use, mobile internet searches have increased and mobile job applications make up a huge share of online job applications \*. If your careers site is [not mobile optimised](http://www.socialtalent.co/blog/mobile-job-search), you run a serious risk of deterring or losing candidates.

Candidates are increasingly likely to make job searches on mobile devices, so if they cannot follow through and make an application from their phone or tablet, you could be missing great candidates.

#### **Keeping your careers page current**

Keep your careers page up do date. If you still have filled positions on your site, you're going to frustrate and confuse potential applicants. Keep your open roles in chronological order of posting, so that a candidate will be able to determine what's new and the type of candidates your recruiting at present.

#### **Make it easy, and dare I say it, fun to apply**

To keep things as succinct as possible, a brief online form is the best way to accept applications. Email applications, PDF job descriptions and other formats introduce various issues. You may not get the information you require from applicants.

> The shorter these forms are, the better it is for your candidate.

Online forms are the best option - allowing a candidate to upload a CV via file upload, or to apply using LinkedIn - which recruiting software accommodates.

#### **Use Short forms**

As stated already, online forms are the easiest means for a candidate to apply. They get the essential information about a candidate and the process is straightforward. The shorter these forms are, the better it is for your candidate. When drafting the job spec, determine what you really need to know about a candidate and carefully select questions that will feed you this information.

Avoid requesting the same information twice (i.e. Don't request employment history if a candidate has uploaded a CV) and ask brief questions to learn more about your candidates.

#### **Get Rid of The login hurdle**

Is it really necessary for an applicant to create a login for your site, in order to make a job application?

Adding an additional hurdle or challenge will deter a candidate from completing an application, as well as limiting your hiring capacity. Reducing the duration and complexity of an application increases your chances of securing top candidates.

#### **Make Branding Clear**

If it's not clear what job your candidate is applying for or to what organisation they are applying to, it may be time to redress your branding. [Branding your careers page consistently](http://www.workology.com/company-careers-page-employment-brand/http://www.workology.com/company-careers-page-employment-brand/) with your main site conveys a sense of professionalism,  as well as ensuring clarity for the candidate. If your careers page or application process is difficult or poorly presented, it will not [inspire confidence](http://www.eremedia.com/ere/the-12-ways-you-can-improve-your-corporate-careers-site/) in your candidate.
