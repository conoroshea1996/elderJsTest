A small HR team carries a serious burden in an organisation. Various tasks that larger organisations have the benefit of delegating to sub-sets within HR, often pile up. A smaller HR team will have to balance everything from recruiting candidates, performance review, benefits, training and even termination. The temptation to outsource is obvious, but sticking it out earlier on can make a huge difference to an organisation.

So how can you avoid outsourcing your HR/Recruitment function? With the wealth of tools available, it has never been easier to [optimise a small team](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246483) to have the highest impact possible. Here’s a few things to consider if you want to get the most out of your little HR team.

#### Structure and process

If you’re working in a growing startup environment, you’ll need to establish a recruitment plan for hiring over the coming months. Setting out profiles of the jobs you need filled will also help you set wider objectives for your fun-sized team. This is one area of work that cannot really be automated, but this aspect of the job benefits greatly from inter-departmental cooperation.

By co-operating with other teams, to learn their objectives, you can set your own. Once you set out the goals and objectives, it is straightforward from there. By understanding the requirements of growing teams and the needs of the existing employees, as well as the new, it can make your job much clearer.

#### Take advantage of analytics

Using recruiting software and other technologies will optimise a small HR team. Recruiting software reduces the demands on your small team and the hiring manager. It also makes the job of communicating with other teams immeasurably easier.
