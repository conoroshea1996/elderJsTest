[The Web Summit](https://websummit.net/) has made the big move and the event, previously held in Dublin, will run from the 7th to 10th November in sunny Lisbon. The biggest tech event of its kind in Europe, the Web Summit will bring together the biggest names in business, technology, media and sports. From startups to titans of industry, the little minnows will be swimming with the blue whales.

This is part of our [HR Events & People](http://hirehive.io/hr-events-and-people/ 'HR Events & People') series

Every imaginable industry is represented, with speakers as diverse as actor, Shailene Woodley, to prime-minister of Portugal, António Costa, to the co-founder of Tinder, Sean Rad… rad indeed. Even HR and recruiting is represented among the many speakers, presenters and exhibitors. The full schedule for all stages is here but here’s a look at some of the most intriguing speakers at this year’s event.
