Everybody loves nerding out over their niche interests. You’ve probably found yourself deep in conversations at the bar, about medieval history, makeup, Star Trek or even model building. You’ve probably also found it difficult to escape some of these very conversations when the enthusiast is in full flight.

HR and recruiting events offer those in the industry a fantastic opportunity to do just that: nerd out about the future of recruiting. Technology, tools and strategies are all up for discussion among attendees and experts can offer their views on the standing of the recruiting industry.

Here’s a few of Autumn/Winter 2016’s top global recruiting events.
