We have always been proud to be an [Indeed](http://indeed.com) job board partner and we have worked with Indeed for many years. Indeed were in fact one of our first partners. Indeed's job board has allowed us to reach a huge pool of candidates worldwide. Today we are excited to announce that we are the first European recruitment software providers to partner with Indeed to offer [Indeed Assessments](https://www.indeed.com/assessments).

Candidate assessments provide a data-driven approach to recruitment. They allow you to hire the right candidates for your company, faster. Now you can use free Indeed Assessments directly from within HireHive. This allows you to store assessment results within the candidate profile.

Raj Mukherjee, SVP of Product at Indeed explains “Resumes are not enough. They offer just one dimension of a candidate’s experience and are time consuming for hiring managers and recruiters to sift through. Assessments also help to democratize hiring by giving job seekers an equal opportunity to showcase their qualifications when applying for jobs, so that they are able to find the right opportunities faster and easier.”

### **Flexible assessment options**

Indeed Assessments offers you the opportunity and the flexibility to screen for the skills most relevant to your current hiring needs. With 50+ ready to use candidate assessments you’ll have an assessment suitable for you or you can just build your own.  Ready to use tests cover cognitive and psychometric tests, computer, language and job skills.  One aspect that really stood out for us as a leading European ATS provider is the language skills assessment options. We see these as being hugely helpful in assessing applicant language skills for a variety of jobs.

Indeed Assessments spans a wide range of job levels, skills and industries, including technology, sales, languages and customer service. Many of the tests include interactive simulations of real-life scenarios. This ensures that you get the most relevant information from your applicants. The tests are mobile optimised, making it easy for candidates to complete the assessments regardless of where they are or what device they are using.

### **A powerful recommendation engine**

Indeed Assessments also has a powerful recommendation engine. This will suggest the most suitable test for your role. You can choose from over 50 pre-built candidate assessments or simply custom build your own.

### **Sending tests and reviewing scores**

Assessments help to provide a clear and consistent candidate experience. Select one or several tests for a candidate (there’s no limit) at any stage in the hiring process. You can send the tests directly from HireHive and once the test has been completed you will see the results on the candidate profile, to more easily assess candidate performance.
