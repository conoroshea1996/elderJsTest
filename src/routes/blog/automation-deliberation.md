Automation tends to raise the hackles on many people, and that is understandable. However, automation does not mean taking the human out of human resources.

Don’t think Hal from ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ or ‘i Robot’: there are a lot of benefits to using automation through recruitment software. With this is mind, here are a few things to consider:

#### **Application process**

The application process has changed significantly over time and automation is just one of many updates to this part of the recruiting pipeline. The application process stands to benefit from automation in a way that favours both recruiter and candidate.

Lengthy forms can create hurdles for candidates and can even result in them abandoning an application mid-way. By having brief forms or the option of populating using LinkedIn or an existing CV, the task becomes much easier for the candidate.

#### **Screening CVs and applications**

The most time-consuming aspect of the recruiting process is likely to be the screening process. A recruiter can spend days screening CVs manually, possibly impacting other parts of the recruiting process.

With the advent of sophisticated recruiting software, automation has benefitted the screening aspect of the recruiting process. Using key terms or requirements, the task of screening CVs can be automatic, whittling down the number of CVs to those with the necessary skills.

#### **Analytics and metrics**

This works two ways. Automation has improved both gathering data and the utilisation of what you learned. [The numbers behind](http://hirehive.io/blog/big-bad-world-metrics/) your most successful hires will help you make more successful hires.

Recruiting software tools will gather data on incoming candidates, helping you to establish common traits among candidates you hire. This automation of data gathering saves significant research time and offers far more accurate results.

#### **Sourcing candidates**

Looking for candidates with a very specific skills set? Looking for candidates with skills in high-demand? Seeking passive candidates? If you are seeking candidates in a specific subset, using traditional forms of recruiting will make your job difficult.

With greater levels of automation in sourcing, you can carry out specific searches using social media outlets, especially, LinkedIn. This process helps you reach the types of candidates you need more effectively and efficiently.

> One of the greatest frustrations for candidates is poor communication

#### **Improvements in communication**

One of the greatest frustrations for candidates is poor communication. Often candidates don't receive an automated response or notification that their application was unsuccessful. [Getting candidate experience wrong](http://hirehive.io/blog/candidate-experience-101/) is a precarious path to tread.

Automation offers a simple solution, with automated emails that can be personalised to the candidate. [HireHive](http://hirehive.io) has a profile for each candidate, through which you can centralise their communications, so keeping in contact is very easy.
