There has been a significant shift in the expectations of employees. Candidates actively avoid high-pressure, inflexible work environments, even if that means a lower wage. Those seeking new opportunities are interested in a greater work-life balance and meaning in their work. But what does this mean for a smaller company's recruiting efforts in the competition for talent?

Though competition for talent remains high, knowing what appeals to candidates makes recruiting easier for small organisations. [Demonstrating your culture and brand](https://hirehive.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-company-culture-and-retain), as well as treating a candidate as an individual gives you a head start of the big global corporations.

> Company culture: you either have it or you do not

#### **Culture**

One aspect where larger organisations cannot compete is in company culture. You either have it or you do not. Candidates seek meaning in their work and a positive working environment. If you can demonstrate this to potential candidates, you have a significant edge in the competition for talent.

Candidates actively seek diversity, [meaningful work](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230970), as well as an environment of collaboration and innovation. Developing your company brand to highlight this to candidates is essential in gaining an advantage over larger organisations.

One aspect of company culture where smaller organisations surpass larger is in hierarchy. Employees seek a less rigid hierarchy and more control over their work. Make sure to assert this advantage in your recruiting efforts.

> #### **Benefits**

[Employee benefits](https://hirehive.com/blog/appreciation-perks-win-candidates/) are a central part of any HR strategy. When employees feel appreciated, culture and retention rates improved. Making employees feel appreciated does not need to cost the moon, but it does require creativity or flexibility. For smaller companies, it is key to bear this in mind.

An improved work-life balance is highly desirable for potential candidates, so consider how you can facilitate this for employees. Can you offer additional time off as a performance bonus? Can you accommodate remote working or work from home?

Smaller companies may not have deep pockets like huge multinationals, but what they do have is the capacity to be flexible and to pay attention to the individual needs of employees.

#### **Recruiting strategy**

Hiring as a smaller company requires a different approach to those employed by large organisations. You may have fewer resources than a company of that size, but you do have a number of distinct advantages.

How you look for candidates is markedly different. You have to define the job and not the individual when devising your recruiting strategy. Again, you will be required to display more flexibility than a larger organisation.

Creativity is key and you may need to devise an innovative strategy to get your name out there. Maybe hold shared recruiting events with other small companies. Or maybe start a referrals program for your existing employees.
