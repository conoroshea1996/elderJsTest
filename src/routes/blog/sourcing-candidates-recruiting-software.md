The root of the job for any recruiter is sourcing candidates. Without candidates, the job of recruiting would be fairly pointless… in fact it would not be a job. The concept of a job would probably not exist. Finding those with the relevant skills can pose a significant challenge and requires a clearly defined strategy, as well as a little help from an effective recruiting software solution.

Making use of your employees’ network is highly effective in sourcing. In this post, we explore a number of ways how recruiters find candidates;

1. [Employee Referrals](#anchor1)
2. [Social Media](#anchor2)
3. [Search Practices](#anchor3)
4. [Posting Jobs](#anchor4)
5. [Referring to past campaigns](#anchor5)

### 1\. Employee referrals

Employee referrals have frequently proven themselves to be one of the [most effective means](http://hirehive.io/blog/employee-referrals-rewards-program/) of sourcing candidates. Candidates who have been referred by existing employees tend to have higher retention rates, are quicker to hire and cheaper to hire. Making use of your employees’ network is highly effective in sourcing.

The best way of making use of your employees connections is having an employee referral program. This involves informing employees at regular intervals of any vacancies and offering some form of reward to employees. That’s it! Recruiting software can be particularly effective in managing this, as well as providing data on successes.

### 2\. Social media

An [active social media presence](http://hirehive.io/blog/social-recruiting-branding-recruiter/) is a great way of broadening your reach, as well as letting candidates know exactly what your organisation is all about. Dedicated careers social media accounts will let you share your open vacancies, engage with passive candidates, share employee testimonials and share posts from the accounts of other areas of the business.

Activity across a broad range of mediums, from Snapchat to Instagram to Twitter, will ensure you are reaching a broad spectrum of candidates, from the experienced to graduates. In addition to that, visual content tends to get shared and viewed more frequently. Visual content will prevent your message from getting lost in the ether.

### 3\. Search practices

If searching online, whether through Job Boards or LinkedIn or similar, have some kind of strategy in mind. Be mindful of the search terms you use, the channels you search and your own requirements. Strategic Boolean searches can yield a good number of qualified candidates.

Take the time to fully assess the skills required of your candidates, the experience, alternate skills or what can be unequivocally excluded. Searches that are too basic will not yield the volumes of candidates needed and will result in suitable candidates being overlooked.

### 4\. Posting jobs

Not to be overlooked, the old traditional means of getting the word out there is still among the most effective. Job boards are often the first place that those seeking a new role will look. Posting jobs can benefit from a little strategy too. Choose job boards that appeal to candidates from a specific industry, where relevant.

An online recruiting system is a very useful tool to the recruiter here, with the possibility to post to multiple job boards at once and manage any applications. HireHive even offers the option to create a custom careers site to post any vacancies to.

### 5\. Refer to past campaigns

Why do the same work twice? Data gathered through previous recruiting campaigns will offer huge insight when hiring again. Sources of top candidates, previous means of appealing to candidates and other data can be easily referred to if you have quantified it.

Using online recruiting software can be particularly effective, as reports are automatically put together as applications come in. With HireHive, reports can be pulled at the [push of a button](http://hirehive.io/recruiting-features/), so you can quantify your previous successes.
