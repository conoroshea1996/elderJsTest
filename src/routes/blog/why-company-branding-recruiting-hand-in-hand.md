Right, we know they’ve got being the biggest technology company in the world on their side when recruiting, but that could mean that they are a soulless, corporate monolith.

Google advertise themselves as a place that caters to workplace wellbeing and that’s what sets them apart. They could easily be a grey, cold corporate monster, but their HR department has worked hard to develop a pleasant culture and to let people know about that when hiring.

> Reputation is everything, so you need to create a clear, compelling picture of what it’s like at your organisation.

In a world where you can google any company, it’s important you let the world know what sets your company apart. Candidates will do their research when applying for a job or going for an interview. Reputation is everything, so you need to create a clear, compelling picture of what it’s like at your organisation. Here are a few things to keep in mind as a recruiter when hiring:

#### **Tell it like it is**

Don’t misrepresent what your company is about. If you have a traditional, corporate environment and observe a dress code, then let candidates know that. By not communicating accurately what your company is about, you risk attracting the wrong kind of candidates.

#### **Look after your own**

Your existing employees are the best brand ambassadors you have, so ensure everyone is on the same page. Branding is as much about your existing team, as it is about any prospective candidates.

There should be consistency across an organisation too, so that your finance department appears to be on the same page as marketing. Branding isn’t just essential to recruitment, branding is key to onboarding and employee retention too, so ensuring consistency is critical.

> If you’ve got generous or unique employee benefits, you should be out on the street with a sandwich board and a megaphone letting the world know.

#### **Sell, sell, sell**

If you’ve got generous or unique employee benefits, you should be out on the street with a sandwich board and a megaphone letting the world know. Do you back employees who engage in voluntary or charity work? Do you have a five-a-side soccer team? Then let candidates know.

Career progression and development are important, even for new hires, so if your company supports employees for further training or has a leadership program, let applicants know even at the earliest stages of the recruiting process.

#### **Cell, cell, cell**

Is your careers site mobile optimised? Is it aesthetically pleasing and easy, or dare I say it, fun to navigate? Do you have employee testimonials or video guides posted? Do you have an active presence on social media platforms outside of LinkedIn?

Your online presence is essential for company branding and should consistently reflect what life at your organisation is like. Communications is important to your company brand too, so recruiting software can help in communicating it in a professional way.

Company branding can take a bit of effort and co-operation with other departments, but it can be a fun way of attracting, as well as hiring, candidates. Talking to existing employees and finding out what makes them happy to work at your organisation can be a heartening and encouraging experience. At the end of the day, company branding is all about what sets your company apart from the rest and you should be proud of that as a recruiter.
