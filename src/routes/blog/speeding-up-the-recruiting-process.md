Ready, set, go! So you have been told that there is a new opening in your organisation and the position needs to be filled soon… what are you waiting for? [To win the competition for talent](https://www.thebalance.com/tips-to-speed-up-hiring-1918325), speeding up the recruiting process is key. You will also need to work out a strategy - eat right, stretch and do the following:

#### **Reconsider how you write job descriptions and advertise jobs**

How you present roles to candidates will have a huge impact on the recruiting timeline. By carefully constructing a job description and taking the time to consider what skills are needed for the role, you will avoid receiving applications from unsuitable candidates. This process will also filter out unsuitable candidates when screening, as you will have criteria to refer to.

How you advertise again impacts the speed of hiring. You should ideally use a variety of strategic platforms to reach the widest range of candidates. Platforms like LinkedIn will have an enormous reach of both job seekers and passive candidates.

> #### **Implement a process of assessment**

By eliminating unsuitable candidates early on, you are speeding up the recruiting process. This is a pretty simple aspect to include in the recruiting process, which can give you a good indication of the type of candidate you are dealing with. Phone screening is one particularly effective technique, which offers a good sense of the individual.

Using basic assessments or [scorecards](https://hirehive.com/blog/candidate-scorecards/) are a useful reference for the recruiter when it comes to the selection stage. HireHive offers the possibility to create interviewing scorecards that allow you to assess the performance of the candidate. As well as that, it focuses you on the requirements of the role.

> #### **Schedule carefully**

By making sure all stakeholders are ready to get involved in the recruiting process, you will avoid delayed decision making and the absence of key decision makers. Letting managers or other key team members into the screening and interviewing process too late is a recipe for disaster.

Ensure that decision makers are not on vacation the time you wish to go through this process. Make sure to schedule in advance so that you are not left trying to get key domain knowledge from interviewees on the fly.

> Your past recruiting efforts will also provide you with a deep talent pool

> #### **Make use of past efforts**

If you are using a recruiting software solution like HireHive, you are likely gathering data on your recruiting efforts. This is not just useful for compliance or running reports - the insights you gather will help you overcome difficulties you have already encountered and avoid unnecessary roadblocks.

Your past recruiting efforts will also provide you with a deep talent pool. You will have screened and interviewed many of these candidates already, but you may have another suitable role for them now. Having done the legwork already, you will be blessed to quickly and efficiently hire them.

#### **Implement a referral program**

[Employee referrals](https://hirehive.com/blog/is-an-employee-referrals-program-the-most-effective-way-to-recruit/) are the recruiter’s best friend. They ensure a better quality of hire and improved retention rates, but more importantly they help in speeding up the recruiting process. By maintaining the referral program, keeping up communication with employees about the program and offering rewards, you can potentially reduce the time to hire.

An ongoing employee referral program is one of the most effective recruiting strategies you can employ. Your employees will help to do some of the screening and skills assessment required as part of the recruiting process.
