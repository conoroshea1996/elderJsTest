The level of competition for top talent is obvious and it's the job of the recruiter to modify their hiring strategy and innovate wherever possible, keep cost or time to hire as low as possible,  and keep all requirements, as well as regulation, at the forefront of your mind.

Getting creative and trying a change of approach can give a recruiter an edge over the competition, in light of all these considerations. Here’s just a few tools you might consider including in your recruitment strategy.

[**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/)

Instagram is fantastic for posting content about your organisation and your team, giving a great insight to candidates. This type of branding explains just exactly how your organisation operates. The huge youth presence on Instagram makes it ideal for recruiting graduates or hiring for junior roles.

[Visual content is much more attention-grabbing](http://www.socialtalent.co/blog/recruiting-with-instagram), so visual media like Instagram make a huge impact. What's noteworthy about Instagram, is that it works with a number of other platforms. Instagram is great for visual job advertisements and offers the opportunity to get creative. Targeted recruiting through instagram can also be very effective to your hiring process.

This is part of our [Recruiting Strategy](http://hirehive.io/recruiting-strategy/) series.

[**Textio**](https://textio.com/)

When posting jobs, sometimes your job ad isn't exactly what you want it to be or [what it should be](http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/writing-effective-job-advertisement-tips/). Listing the requirements of the role is obviously a big chunk of your responsibility when recruiting, but the type of individual or the type of candidate can be as significant. Making a good culture fit or finding someone with the right attitude is as significant.

Textio is great at analysing your job ad for elements that might attract or dissuade the type of candidate you want to hire. This word processor uses data to help you to avoid bias in your job postings and find the sorts of applicants you need.

[**Snapchat**](https://www.snapchat.com/)

You might think this is only for the tweenies, but like many social media tools, Snapchat lends itself to branding and informing candidates about the day-to-day running of your organisation, as well as providing employee insights. You're more likely to reach candidates, most significantly those who are not actively seeking a new role, using widely used social media tools.

[Hiring millennials](http://www.inc.com/mark-miller/8-things-you-must-do-when-hiring-millennials.html) is helped significantly by tools like Snapchat. Initial applications or pitches can even be submitted through the medium of Snapchat. It offers the capacity for huge reach, with very little effort and planning – embrace the transient nature of Snapchat.

**Interactive video**

Video has long been a friend to the recruitment process. From video ads, day-in-the-life type content to video interviewing, the possibilities are endless. Video works over multiple platforms and is an easy way to communicate with potential candidates. One recent development in online video that might be worth incorporating into your recruiting strategy is interactive video.

It offers the option for the potential applicant to interact with any video content to pique their curiosity in your organisation. [Deloitte](http://www.afr.com/technology/deloitte-creates-customised-game-for-recruiting-graduates-20160227-gn5hyb) recently used this to great effect, fusing interactive video with gamification for a graduate recruitment campaign.

**Recruiting software**

Tools like HireHive are constantly updating, innovating and consolidating multiple tools, making the recruiter’s life a lot easier. Reporting tools, interview scheduling and communications are all catered for. Streamlining all aspects of your recruitment strategy can save an awful lot of time and money.
