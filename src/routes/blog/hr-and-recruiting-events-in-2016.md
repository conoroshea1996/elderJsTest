Want to meet up with other recruiting and HR professionals to discuss the challenges of recruiting where there's a skills gap? Or to find out about new products and technologies for use in the hiring process? You could try dialling 1800-HR-PROS, to chat with recruiters in your area, but I think you would have a better chance attending one of the variety of recruiting events coming up in 2016.

Here's a few European recruiting events, coming up in the next few months, looking at ways of innovating, changing the HR landscape in light of an increasingly digital based industry. From analytics, to disruptive technologies, to innovation in the digital world, every aspect of HR and recruiting gets a look in.

Talent leaders connect is held over a number of dates, in a number of locations in the UK and Ireland, so there’s really no excuses for missing it. The event is designed for senior HR staff and takes the form of half conference, half networking event. Talks come from industry experts and participants are encouraged to take part in Masterclass Roundtables on relevant topics.

Each of the series events have a different focus, with themes ranging from HR Analytics, to Emerging Talent, to Sourcing and Attracting. Speakers at their Year Ahead 2016 Event include Lauren Wright, Head of Global Business Expansion at Glassdoor and Nic Marks, Director at Happiness Works. Best of all, tickets for these events are free, but on a first-come, first-serve basis.
