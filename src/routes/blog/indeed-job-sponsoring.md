Great news! We have partnered directly with [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/) for sponsored job postings to allow you to reach even more candidates on the world's number one job board! Here is how to make the most of Indeed job sponsoring directly from your HireHive account.

Indeed is the world’s #1 job site with over 200 million monthly visitors\*. Sponsored Jobs appear in the most prominent areas of the search results, driving more applications to your job.

You only pay for results. You choose your budget and when to stop sponsoring your job. You only pay when a candidate clicks on your job. There are no one-size-fits-all posting fees.

Based on data from HireHive customers, approximately 90% of the total number of applicants will apply for a role within the first 5 days. After this date the rate of applications drops dramatically - mainly because other jobs have made their way to the top, ahead of your role. This varies by job of course, depending on the volume of roles but often your job can be pushed to page three or four of the jobs listings by the time the posting is just three days old.

Set up is really easy - if you have a HireHive account and an Indeed account just post a job and select ‘Sponsor on Indeed’. If you don’t have either of these, what are you waiting for?
