It’s that time of year again - it’s time for The Web Summit. At HireHive we have been attending the Web Summit since the early days when there were 1500 attendees (we were a startup exhibitor once upon a time...) when it was still in Dublin and a much smaller affair. In 2017 59,115 people attended.

We have continued to attend since it moved to Lisbon and it’s always an important date in our calendars. This year many of the HireHive team will pack their suitcases and be in Lisbon for the week. There are so many benefits from these types of events and this year another big plus for us, is that all our remote working staff get to meet in Lisbon.

### Time to talk

Web Summit has grown into something huge - with [‘tracks’](https://websummit.com/tracks) covering all topics from SAAS to Money, from Sport to Marketing. Some of the interesting talks for us this year are:

- \***\*Hiring: Storiqa  
   \*\***CEO Andrian Galkin talks about how they hire the best at cyrptocurrency marketplace, Storiqa.
- \***\*Hiring: Pipedrive  
   \*\***We’re big fans of Pipedrive here at HireHive. Co-founder, Martin Henk discusses how they find and hire the best.
- \***\*How to hire (and keep) the best  
   \*\***Our very own, John Dennehy will be speaking at this along with Daniel Yanisse, Co-founder of Checkr, Kristen Garcia Dumont CEO, MZ and Lindsey Turrentine Editor-in-Chief, CNET

The full schedule is available here.

The talks are great and provide a really good insight into various businesses and topics but a big part for us has always been what happens around Web Summit, who you meet over lunch or at the Night Summit. Connections are made everywhere. Places like the Booking.com Women in Tech lounge is a great place to facilitate this. They have a place to sit down and gather your thoughts (and charge your phone) while also meeting with other women in tech.

Will you be at this years Web Summit? We'd love to meet you - just get in touch.
