A year back, Google Hire announced that they are sunsetting their ATS. If you are still trying to figure out what you're going to do with all your recruitment data and to find new software to manage your recruitment process, keep reading. Google Hire let you down, but I can promise that HireHive won't. Here are a few reasons why:

**HireHive is stable**

This is our first argument. HireHive is a mature applicant tracking system that has been around for **over nine years** and will continue for many, many more years. We don't plan on 'sunsetting' HireHive. Ever.

**Low-cost transparent pricing**

HireHive charges a monthly subscription based on the number of open jobs at any one time. It’s low cost (from as little as $49 per month), no minimum term, and all of our pricing is online [here](https://hirehive.com/pricing-plans/). We even provide a [14-day free trial](https://my.hirehive.io/register) so you can try the product.

**Feature-rich**

HireHive provides deep functionality for the most demanding of recruitment teams including collaborative hiring, calendar appointments, in-app messaging, easy search and sorting of candidates, automated job board posting to major jobs sites such as Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter and Monster.

**Easy to use**

HireHive requires little to no training to get new users up to speed. This makes it ideal for recruitment and HR teams that are already busy.

**Legally compliant**

HireHive is GDPR and EEOC compliant making it ideally suited for users both in the US and Europe.

**Excellent support**

We pride ourselves in excellent customer support for all users.

**Free data import**

To help you with the transition to your new ATS, we offer all Google Hire customers a free data import. We've been working with many companies over the past few months so we're well experienced to help you get set up with a new ATS.

If you're still trying to find the perfect ATS for you and think HireHive could be a good fit, [book a demo](https://calendly.com/maelledefrancesco/hirehive-demo) with us and we'll walk you through our different features!
