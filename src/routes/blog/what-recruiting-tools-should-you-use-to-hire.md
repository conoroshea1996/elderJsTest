We will look for any means of cutting corners in life. It is human nature to try to find a hack or a shortcut and the same goes for recruiting. There are a variety of recruiting tools that can make our job easier and here are just a few:

#### **Recruiting software**

[Recruiting software](https://hirehive.io/recruiting-features/) is the essential all-rounder for recruiting. It consolidates all the tools you need to engage with candidates in one place. Along with that, you can post jobs to a number of job sites at once, reaching as wide an audience as possible.

In a world where big data is everything, you can also generate reports on any data gathered by recruiting software. Plus, you can manage your employee referrals scheme, as well as setting up a careers site.

#### **Communications**

Recruiting software will help you with some of the major communications tasks of recruiting. It will retain any messages or emails between you and your candidates for future reference. Also, this process will make sharing with the rest of your team straightforward.

Other useful communications tools that you should include in your recruiting arsenal are instant messaging tools like [Slack](https://slack.com/). Ideal as a collaboration tool, you can search past conversations plus archive any materials shared.

#### **Social media**

You are nothing without a [social media](https://hirehive.io/blog/begin-social-recruiting-strategy/) presence and it would be foolish to underestimate the value of social media in your selection of recruiting tools. Twitter or Instagram can be included in your advertising process, and it would be a crime to overlook the recruiting monolith that is LinkedIn.

Your recruiting software will help you share job postings to social media. If you want to develop some dedicated careers content for your social media accounts, then consider a tool like Buffer to schedule your content posting.

#### **Project management tools**

It can be challenging to get an overview of what is happening in a project or what you have to do next. Project management tools are useful in any recruiting campaign. Breaking any project up into tasks helps gain perspective.

Tools like Trello, a web-based project management tool, allow you to break projects up into boards and task lists. This way, sharing with your colleagues and getting an overview of what you need to do is simple.

#### **Advanced searching**

The everyday tasks of the recruiter are tough. From trying to get the contact details of a passive candidate, to seeking appropriate candidates for a task then looking into a candidateâ€™s web presence, work is difficult.

There are a variety of tools to help you find the email address of a candidate, among them the Chrome extension Discoverly. Also, you can get an overview of a candidate's web presence by using tools like Peekyou.
