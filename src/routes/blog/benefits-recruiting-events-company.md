_Are recruiting events the way to go in your next phase of hiring? They can demonstrate your culture and work, as well as allowing you to show off your team._

Events are a great way of engaging with those working in the same industry as yourself. They can give you great insight into trends and new developments, but how might they help your recruiting efforts? Here are just a few ways that events can help you make great hires.

> By holding industry events, you offer the perfect opportunity to get those interested in your company engaged with your work

#### **Attract those interested in your organisation**

The ideal candidate will already be familiar with your organisation and your work. If a fan of your organisation and your achievements wants to get involved with your team, how can you resist?

By holding industry events, you offer the perfect opportunity to get those interested in your company engaged with your work. An event relating to your work can act as a fantastic lure for those interested.

#### **Involves your whole organisation in the process**

[Your existing team members](https://hirehive.com/how-existing-employees-can-help-you-hire/) are the best asset you have and no truer is this than in your recruiting efforts. They develop your product, your stature in industry and your culture. Any input they have in the recruiting process is invaluable.

Events allow your existing team to engage with other industry professionals and let them understand what your company is doing. Your team will also be able to recognise talent when they see it and this will allow them to contribute to the recruiting process.

> Phone screening is useful, but what is better than face-to-face contact?

#### **Initial screening**

Phone screening is useful, but what is better than face-to-face contact? Events can help you engage with potential hires and get a good sense of what they are all about. Interview time can be limited and may not allow you to get the information you need from the candidate.

Your recruiting process may be expedited by engaging with sought-after candidates at events.

#### **Culture**

[Company culture](https://hirehive.com/should-your-company-culture-change-your-approach-to-recruiting/) is a significant selling point in any recruiting project. A big part of company culture is how a company regards its employees and their work. Any potential candidate will want to understand how you work, before committing to a  new role.

Events can help to demonstrate your company as an open organisation and an industry leader. Events also allow existing employees to demonstrate your culture in action.

#### **Building your company’s brand**

Events can help you build your [company’s brand](https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/shaping-employer-brand/) and help you make a statement about what your company stands for. Building your company’s brand is a long-term effort and requires constant attention, but events can help you share your values with a large group of industry professionals at once.

By clearly asserting how you work and how you operate as a team, it becomes easier to attract the kind of talent you need. Events can help you assert your company as an influential organisation in industry.

#### **Building a talent pool**

It’s not what you know, but who you know. Industry events allow you to engage with individuals directly involved in the type of work you do. By building a significant network of connections, you can reduce the work of finding talent later.

Industry events are likely to attract those already working in the same area, so you will be in contact with large groups of people with the skill sets your company needs.
