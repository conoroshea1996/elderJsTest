Including your colleagues in the recruiting process will give you unrivalled insight into their experiences, which will help you make better hires. All it takes is a little communication with your existing team.

You and your colleagues may be able to allay this anxiety for new hires.

By including your team in onboarding, you will quickly integrate any new hires into your team. The buddy system is always a fantastic idea, to help answer the types of questions everyone has. It also helps start on the job training with those who understand the job requirements best.
