Due to the growing amount of companies embracing this cultural shift to social sourcing, one must also be aware of how this type of recruiting is performing. There is no denying that this type of recruiting makes the recruitment process efficient, cost-effective and most importantly, faster. Social media allows companies to reach both active and passive candidates, as well as building a community of followers. Here are some useful social recruiting tools to find top talent.

## **How do you measure Social Media Platforms?**

What companies find most challenging is measuring and monitoring their social media platforms. Therefore, monitoring and managing their platforms on a weekly if not daily basis is vital. It is all a question of preparation before you dive straight into the cultural shift that is social sourcing. Start off by setting goals that you wish to achieve in a specified time frame, measure the outcome of these goals against your initial expectations and finally, evaluate what is working and what needs changing.

You may need to ask yourself the following questions in order to fully evaluate your social media strategy; Are you reaching a talented pool of candidates? Are you engaging with these talent pools? How many of your followers are interacting with your social media posts? How many of your followers are actually applying for your jobs?

Here are the main social media analytic tools you need in order to measure and manage your social media reach and performance;
