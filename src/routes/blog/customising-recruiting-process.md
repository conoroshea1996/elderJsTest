Remember when bedazzling was a thing? For a brief time in the 90s, you weren't a pre-teen girl worth your salt if you hadn't embellished a t-shirt or hat with rhinestones or glitter. Tell me please, what's stopping us from doing this in recruiting?

Why can't we jazz up a careers page or glitz up a recruiting procedure? The bedazzling tool of the recruiter is online recruiting software and here are a few ways you can customize your application process. Might not work so well with old jeans though.

#### Mind your language

Localisation is an essential part of marketing and sales in a globalised world. The recruiter is ultimately a salesperson, so why should recruiting be any different? If you need a [candidate with a particular language set](http://hirehive.io/blog/recruiter-abroad-hire-multilingual-candidates-globally/), advertise in the desired language.

HireHive helps in this endeavour, by helping you to localise job application forms and automatic responses, ensuring an improved experience for your applicants. You can customize your application process to suit your candidates perfectly.

#### Custom questions

You know for certain, with particular roles, that there are some skill sets or requirements you cannot do without. In advertising jobs, you should just come out and ask them. Knowing this can determine whether a candidate is suitable for a job or not.

HireHive allows you to customise your job application process to include a set of basic questions. This seriously helps your filtering of candidates and helps candidates understand what you need.

#### Custom careers site

A customized careers site screams professionalism and looks impressive to candidates. You can ensure your branding is consistent and offer further insight on available roles to your prospective employees. Your careers page can reflect your organisation's culture and needs clearly.

> Using HireHive, you can create a customized careers site for any roles you may currently have on offer

Using HireHive, you can create a customized careers site for any roles you may currently have on offer. You can even categorise them by department or business area, making the site much easier to browse.

#### Customizing stages in the pipeline

Having a well-oiled, well-running hiring process will save time and money. Having a process for advertising, filtering, screening, interviewing and, finally, hiring, will give you and your team confidence in the process. Once that is in place, the recruiting process becomes straightforward and seamless.

However you hire, HireHive helps you to categorise your candidates, no matter how many stages they may go through. You can create stages and give them distinctive names to label them. Whatever form your process takes, [HireHive can be customised](http://hirehive.io/help/managing-jobs/customising-the-application-process/) to reflect that.

> If you need a candidate with a very specific skill set, a test or assessment may be necessary as part of the recruiting process

#### Assessments or tests

If you need a candidate with a very specific skill set, a test or assessment may be necessary as part of the recruiting process. If the candidate does not pass muster, you can exclude them from consideration.

Tasks can vary from problem-solving to copywriting to writing examples of code. If you can put together a standard test for all applicants, you can include it early on in the application process, so candidates can demonstrate their abilities.
