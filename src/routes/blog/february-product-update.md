What happened in the Hive during those past few weeks? It's time for our February product update!

#### **Reordering categories and your pipeline** 

This feature was hugely requested by our customers. And we heard them! You can now drag and drop your job categories and your candidate pipeline to reflect your workflow order. You now have even more options to customise your process within HireHive.

#### **Restricted Job notes** 

In February we worked on giving you the possibility to create restricted notes on the job details page. You can now add restricted notes to jobs in the same way you would on a candidate profile to ensure all job information is captured but is not displayed to all users.

#### **Support**

Another big change we worked on during the past few weeks is our brand new [Support Centre](https://hirehive.com/support/). If you ever have questions or need more information on all you can do with HireHive, you will more than likely find answers there!

#### GDPR compliance with HireHive

We have also been busy making HireHive ready for GDPR. We are working on our new features to give our customers the ability to be fully GDPR compliant with their recruitment data using our software. We'll keep you updated on these great features!
