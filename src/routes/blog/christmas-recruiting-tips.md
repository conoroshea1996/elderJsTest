Christmas is the season of how-tos and festive domestic tips. You cannot turn your head without reading a guide on how to make a homemade wreath, or how to deep-fry a turkey. This are things no-one realistically has the time or inclination to do, but they will bookmark the webpage, with the conviction that they will in fact do thas at some point.

This enthusiasm for festive creativity certainly has its place in the world of recruiting. It is well known that a little creativity goes a long way when preparing for a recruiting campaign, so what possibly could go wrong by adding a little festive flourish? I’ll let you be the judge.

#### **Stealth festive cheer**

It is best not to overwhelm candidates or the team looking to recruit with too much christmassy content. In this case I would suggest a little subtlety in the approach, so try to sneak it in where applicable.

One technique I would suggest is stealth inclusion of christmas-related terms into marketing content

One technique I would suggest is stealth inclusion of christmas-related terms into marketing content. Why not find and replace non-christmas terms with festive terms? Why not try replacing you’ll with yule? Or no prior experience required, with snow prior experience required?

#### **Decorate your interview venue**

Finding an appropriate location for an interview in a busy office can be tough. Getting the interviewers you need at a suitable time can be tougher still. Why not make the whole experience a little more fun for recruiters and candidates by decorating the interview room?

If you are wondering, where’s the sense in that, here is something to consider: this might be an interesting way to see how the candidate reacts in unusual situations. I would advise avoiding singing and dancing electronic Santas in this case.

Everyone loves a good old christmas song. Whether a traditional carol or cheesy 80s pop, they always seem to receive an enthusiastic reception.

#### **Start all screening calls with a Christmas carol**

Everyone loves a good old christmas song. Whether a traditional carol or cheesy 80s pop, they always seem to receive an enthusiastic reception.

Whether using a recording or doing your own rendition, singing a christmas carol at the start of any screening call will put the candidate at ease. Who knows? Maybe they will even join in. Always ensure to use royalty free music or try to remain compliant with intellectual property laws.

#### **Gift wrapping**

When the whole process of recruiting is done, the next job is getting a contract ready for the new hire and starting the recruiting process, which is a positive thing for candidate and recruiter. It marks a successful end to the process.

With all this positive feeling, why not gift wrap any contracts being issued. Before getting all documentation packed into an A4 envelope and into the postbox, cover it up in some wrapping paper and a bow.

#### **Give everyone and everything christmassy names**

You know how all those who work on The Simpsons get given Halloween-themed nicknames for the Halloween specials? It is quite impressive how they manage to shoehorn a spooky element into every name.

What's stopping us from doing this? Why not change all candidate profiles in your recruiting software to festive alternatives? I think there is enough festive payoff to compensate for the mass confusion caused.
