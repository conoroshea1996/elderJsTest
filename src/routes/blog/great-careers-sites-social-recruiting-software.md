However turning a job view into an application requires more than just a generic job spec.

We see over and over again that companies that promote their employer brand receive more quality applications than those who merely pay lip-service to the term 'employer brand'.

The most direct method of sharing your jobs is posting them to your website. This can be done either through a widget (a short snippet of code placed on your website page).

It can also be done through our new careers site. It is important to have an engaging and clear careers site and paramount to have a clear and short candidate application process. We've made everything as simple as possible. It's really easy to set up. No lists of options, or mountains of choices. Just a quick and easy way of getting a quality site live and running.

We showcase five companies that are using their HireHive careers site to great effect.
