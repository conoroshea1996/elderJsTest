_Recruiting silly season is fast approaching. Your team, timing and recruiting software solution might be the key to making top hires._

September always sees a huge peak in recruiting. With the end of the financial year approaching and the prospect of funding, teams will make new hires where necessary. As this is the case for every organisation, the competition for talent is intense for September hiring.

To make successful hires, recruiters need to act very fast. You need to introduce efficiencies to your process, like a recruiting software solution to get to top talent first. Here are a few tips for hiring during the annual Autumn peak.

#### **Start early**

You may be reading this article a little late, but the key to successful September hiring is starting early. By taking advantage of a quiet July and August, you will have a head start on getting to the top talent. January and September recruiting sees recruiters battling for qualified applicants, as open roles often outnumber those candidates with the necessary skills.

By advertising to candidates and engaging with them early on, you may be able to make an offer and onboard in September, rather than recruit. [Job searches](https://www.socialtalent.co/blog/latest-research-when-are-the-busiest-months-for-recruitment-activity) climb as early as May, so even though roles may not be available until September, you need to get the process going as soon as possible.

#### **Referrals**

When it comes to September hiring, time is of the essence. If you are too slow to start the recruiting process or too slow to make an offer to a suitable candidate, you are likely to be missing out on top talent. One way of speeding up your recruiting process is seeking referrals from your existing team.

By implementing an employee referral scheme, you will be able to win the war for top talent. You can use recruiting software like HireHive to set up such a program in your company.

#### **Training and onboarding**

If there are vacant roles at your company, your team needs to support a new hire. While the competition for talent is the top concern of recruiters, [onboarding](https://hirehive.com/blog/best-practice-onboarding-new-employees-organisation/) and training a new hire is the next point of concern. Effective onboarding and training is essential for employee retention.

By having a training and an onboarding program prepared for any new hires, you will be able to ensure that they are settled and integrated into your existing team. A general training program for new hires and programs like the buddy system can be arranged well ahead of time.
