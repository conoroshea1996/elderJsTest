Keeping growth of your recruitment team up with the rate of growth of the rest of the organisation can pose a challenge. Growth is dependent on sufficient staffing, but first you have to hire a recruiting team. Recruiting should ideally be integrated with every department in your organisation. Recruiting and general operations are co-dependent. Keeping recruiting up with growth can be achieved by some planning and organisation.

#### Forecast

This may seem a challenging task and you may feel the need to refer to crystal balls or tarot cards to get an indication. If you can set out an [approximate list](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/forecasting-methods-used-personnel-planning-recruiting-58759.html) of required hires for the coming months, it puts you and your organisation in a much safer position. Finding yourself short-staffed a few months down the road may stymie rapid growth. The simple solution is this: planning.

#### Hire an internal recruiter

Setting aside budget for hiring a recruiter may seem a little overwhelming, but it's necessary to sustain growth. When it comes down to the brass tacks of it, an internal recruiter is cheaper. Instead of shelling out anything up to [20% of an employee's first year cost](http://www.socialtalent.co/blog/how-much-should-i-be-paying-in-recruitment-fees) to an agency hire a recruiter you can integrate with your core team.

#### Work out a broader HR program

Your HR and recruiting teams go hand-in-hand. Hiring candidates is only a small part of the job. If you see the need for intensive hiring in the coming months and years, you'll need to work out a system of on boarding, training, benefits, performance review, among others. Working out a coordinated plan for what your workforce will need will help your new, growing recruitment team, as well as your whole organisation.recruiting system

#### Diversity

Diversity is essential in any organisation, of any size and your recruitment team is no different. When hiring, carefully considered the skills and personalities of your potential new hires to your recruiting team. As time of rapid growth will introduce pressure and some uncertainty, you will be tempted to hire those similar to yourself. Resist this temptation and seek out those who will bring something new to your team.

#### Invest in recruiting software

[Online recruiting systems](http://hirehive.io/why-recruiting-software-could-change-the-way-you-recruit/) are great support to a small team, but is also fully scalable for when growth and recruiting ramp up. Many processes can be automated and reporting is made effortless through the use of such software. This takes the pressure off a limited team, whose attentions may be pulled in several different directions. As a team grows, it's also easy to securely share information with your recruiting team.

#### Plan what and who you need to hire

Do you need a HR manager? Do you need recruiting or talent acquisition staff? Just as with forecasting, you need to determine what you are likely to need to keep up with growth. Set goals to add shape to your strategy. You should also consider hiring those with a [diverse set of skills](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236238). When there's significant growth, you'll need a team who will be able to multitask and balance a number of responsibilities.
