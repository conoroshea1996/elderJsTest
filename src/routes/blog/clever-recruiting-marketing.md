Recruiters should always be looking for new and exciting ways of getting the word out there and if they can be integrated with your recruiting software, better again. Here’s a few of the ways you can do effective recruiting marketing and a few exemplars of standard.

#### **Social media**

Social media is one of the most formidable tools of our time and cleverly used, it is unrivalled in recruiting marketing. It can also be used in conjunction with online recruiting software. [73% of recruiters](http://www.socialtalent.co/blog/social-media-for-recruitment-facts-figures-fun-stuff) have made successful hires through social media. By understanding what the particular platforms are about or how they can be best utilised, you put yourself in a very good position. When using social media to recruit, the world is your oyster.

#### **Example/case study**

Who better to refer to here than Twitter? To recruit, they share content reflecting their culture and day-to-day work, along with job ads. They even employed a multi-platform approach, evidenced by their ‘[At Twitter, the Future is You!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vccZkELgEsU)’ video that got a lot of attention at the time of its release.

#### **Careers Site**

A customised careers site is a must. If you have the budget, do it. A professional-looking, dedicated careers site should inform and entice potential candidates. A careers site can be a vehicle for both your job ads, as well as a platform for communicating your company culture. Tip: you can use HireHive to generate a [customised careers page](http://hirehive.io/recruiting-features/).

#### **Example/case study**

[Spotify’s careers site](https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/) is a particularly impressive example. It does its basic job well, splitting jobs by business area, including a section for students and selecting a few featured jobs for the home page. What makes it unique is their ‘Meet the Team,’ including a Spotify player with the employee’s favourite song.

#### **Word of mouth/referrals**

Referrals are one of the most effective ways of hiring. Quality of hire increases and time to hire reduces, simply by implementing an employee referrals program. Your employees are the ideal ambassadors for your organisation, so a good word from them could point you in the direction of great candidates.

#### **Example/case study**

Booking.com deserves a round of applause for its referral program. When they needed Portuguese speaking staff, they ordered in Portuguese food for their staff and let them know the candidates they were looking for. Successful and delicious.

#### **Email marketing**

It’s a little bit old-school and overuse can get into the territory of spam, but you shouldn't overlook the power of email marketing. Email allows you free reign content wise. You can create an impressive targeted campaign with very little effort and include GIFs. Everyone loves GIFs.
