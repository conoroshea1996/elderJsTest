_All good things take time in recruiting, but what if you are losing candidates as a result? Recruiting software might be the key to introducing efficiencies._

Time is of the essence. In the current environment where the war for talent is so intense, you cannot afford to take your time and let candidates lose interest. One area that could be a danger zone in your recruiting efforts is a lengthy application and recruiting process.

If your recruiting process involves convoluted forms or a drawn-out interviewing process, you may be alienating potential new hires. Tools like recruiting software can certainly help, as well as a few small changes to your strategy. So here are a few potential problems inefficiencies can cause and how you might fix them.

> #### **Problem: Repetitive application forms**

There is no greater frustration for a job applicant than a long, repetitive application form. Why should they have to provide detailed information about their career, when they will also be instructed to upload a CV? This may even be causing candidates to [abandon applications](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7238-online-job-application-pains.html) mid way through.

#### **Solution?**

Keep the application process as lean as possible. Only ask the questions you really need to and do not ask candidates to provide the same information multiple times. Integrate with platforms like LinkedIn where possible. HireHive helps you set up application forms, so you can keep things as simple as possible.

#### **Problem: Poor communications**

This figure gets quoted quite a bit: [70% of candidates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2013/12/08/5-tips-for-a-winning-candidate-experience/#698f2db64b50) do not even receive an automated response when they complete a job application. If communications are poor (or non-existent), your recruiting process could mistakenly be perceived as being slow or inefficient. If candidates do not know what the status of their application is, they may just look elsewhere.

#### **Solution?**

This one is pretty easy to fix. Once you know a candidate has not been shortlisted, let them know. If they have been selected for an interview, let them know. If you would like more detail on their experience, get in contact. Maintaining contact from one location can easily be done with a recruiting tool like HireHive.

> Sometimes the process seems to take so long for candidates, they just look elsewhere

#### **Problem: Lengthy interviewing and screening processes**

Sometimes the process seems to take so long for candidates, they just look elsewhere, assuming the role is gone. The recruiter may be in contact, but no date or time is given for an interview, which makes a candidate feel like they are not being taken seriously.

#### **Solution?**

Even if your process is taking a little longer than you would like, there is an easy fix here. By just giving your candidates a date for an interview or a time for a call, even a few weeks ahead of time, they will feel that you are engaging with them. HireHive features an interviewing [scheduling tool](https://hirehive.com/recruiting-features/interview-scheduling/) that can be integrated with Outlook and Gmail.
