Although webinars are a great way to learn, you don't want to waste your valuable time. There's no point blankly watching a boring webinar that talks about what you already know or that is irrelevant. Here are three webinars that we think are worth checking out.

#### Social Talent

These guys make the bold claim that they will turn you into a 'Recruiting Ninja' and we can truly say they know what they are doing. We've completed their Black Belt training and feel this is definitely one to check out. As well as this training they offer weekly webinars (held on Wednesdays).
