Spring is in the air, there are daffodils in the park, lambs in the field...and it is time to do a thorough springclean of your recruiting process. If you have a recruiting software solution, your job is that bit easier, with all necessary tools and resources at your disposal.

If you do not have a recruiting software solution, here are a few reasons to consider introducing one to your organisation.

#### **Job Ads**

If you are taking the time to springclean your recruiting process and database, one aspect of the process that may need a wipe from a polishing cloth is your job advertising. If job descriptions are not sufficiently detailed, you will get unsuitable applications. Work out a standard strategy for your team.

#### **Social**

[Social media outlets](http://hirehive.io/blog/begin-social-recruiting-strategy/) and your website are key to public perception of your organisation, as well as your recruiting efforts. If things have gotten a little out of date or old job postings are still active, you might frustrate candidates. Do a good sweep of your online presence, getting rid of anything dated.

#### **Compliance**

Your databases and recruiting process are not just useful for your own projects. They are also essential for compliance with labour laws. Ensure that you have all necessary processes in place, so that you always have proper records on candidates, as well as reason for non-selection.

#### **Unify your efforts**

One good way of springcleaning is streamlining your tools and efforts. If you are not currently using recruiting software, this might be the time to implement. Tools like HireHive can unify your advertising, screening, interviewing and metrics efforts.

#### **Timetable**

If you are presently doing a clear out, you are probably asking yourself, “why don't we do this more often?” This is a good opportunity to set up a regular plan for going through your database of candidates and clearing out as necessary.

#### **Sorting hat**

If you are taking the time to do a little tidying up, maybe use the time to sort your current talent pools. By sorting candidates by area, it is much easier to use the information you have strategically.

> Now is the time to analyse your data to establish where your successes and failures have been

#### **Rework processes**

If you have been using an online recruiting software solution, like HireHive, you will have gathered [considerable data](http://hirehive.io/blog/big-bad-world-metrics/) on your hiring process. Now is the time to analyse your data to establish where your successes and failures have been. It also offers the opportunity to rework your current processes in light of this information.

#### **Reevaluate goals**

With new insights learned from your data, you have the option to reevaluate your recruiting goals. While recruiting may go through varying intensity throughout the year, you can have strategies in place. Take this information gleaned from your recruiting software and work out your recruiting goals.
