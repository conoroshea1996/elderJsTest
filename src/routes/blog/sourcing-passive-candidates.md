We always want what we can't have. Passive candidates are no different. The best candidates seem unreachable, already settled in jobs. So it takes a strong pitch and serious convincing to get someone to change. Already, the odds are stacked against you, with [¾ of potential qualified candidates](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2015/06/10-ideas-for-effectively-recruiting-passive-candidates) not even considering a change.

So here are a few things to keep in mind when reaching out to passive candidates.

> Building a network and rapport with qualified individuals is key in enticing candidates

#### **Social media**

When getting in contact with passive candidates, [LinkedIn is often a go-to tool](http://www.eremedia.com/tlnt/why-linkedin-could-be-your-1-source-for-quality-passive-candidates/) for recruiters. It's probably the easiest way to get in contact with desirable candidates, without seeming very forward. Building a network and rapport with qualified individuals is key in enticing candidates, who wouldn't otherwise be looking for new opportunities.

Engaging on other forms of social media, like Twitter, will show you are interested in what they have to say. It's always flattering when an organisation shows interest in someone as a professional, so use this to your advantage.

#### **Job Advertising**

How you advertise your jobs will impact how you appeal to any kind of candidate. Writing a [compelling advertisement](http://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/9-steps-to-writing-job-ads-top-candidates-cant-resist.html), appealing to what makes them tick as a professional, could be the difference between hiring or not.

When posting jobs, by appealing to their value system and offering a greater level of job satisfaction, you’re going to win over candidates who are on the fence. Passive candidates, happy in their current role, will often keep a finger on the pulse, checking in on the kinds of roles are available. Then if you make an [offer they cannot refuse](http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/writing-effective-job-advertisement-tips/), you may find yourself getting prospective applications.

> The way that you communicate with candidates is key in the recruitment process

#### **Communication**

The way you communicate with candidates is key in the recruitment process. You have to strike a balance between casually networking, and the other extreme: pestering a candidate. Cold calling may be a bit heavy handed, so focus on email or social media. Recruiting software is especially effective in maintaining communication and building a talent pool.

Contacting a candidate and expecting them to consider a job change on the basis of one email is [unrealistic](http://www.socialtalent.co/blog/the-complete-guide-to-emailing-passive-candidates), so networking and building a rapport is essential. As stated above, you’re making a pitch, so you have to make a compelling argument for change. As per usual, you should keep up steady communication with candidates, making the benefits and responsibilities clear to the candidate.

Personalise any communication, as often approaching passive candidates can seem somewhat impersonal. Candidates may have the perception you sent the same email to 10 others. If you make reference to their experience and skills, you will convince candidates you are serious. Also, take inspiration from this [Google recruiter](https://twitter.com/pjf/status/730215052750381056).

#### **Don't make a distinction between passive and active candidates**

It's also possible, that making a distinction between your candidates [could be problematic](http://www.eremedia.com/ere/passive-candidates-are-not-the-holy-grail-of-recruiting/). In the area of recruiting, it's the end goal that matters, not the means.

Treating passive candidates like the holy grail means you can overlook active candidates, who are already [interested, engaged and open to change](http://recruitingdaily.com/active-candidates-passive-candidates-recruiting/). Key principles apply to the hiring of any candidate: good communication, making a strong pitch and having a good rapport with applicants.
