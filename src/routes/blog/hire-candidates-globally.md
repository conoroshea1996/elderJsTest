The trouble with talented, qualified multilingual employees, is that they can be notoriously difficult to find. You may have an urgent need to hire, so you can cater for your global market, but it is unlikely that you are the only one doing this. Competition is stiff.

To get the quality candidates, you might need to recruit globally, which has a whole new collection of regulations to consider and often requires a whole new change of approach. From advertising in target languages, to testing candidates and remaining aware of international labour laws, there’s much to learn before recruiting abroad. Here’s a few tips for the global recruiter.

> Just because someone can make basic conversation in a second language, that does not mean they have the language skills to make a sale or to discuss technical terms

#### Language testing

[Language testing is essential](http://hirehive.io/how-to-hire-the-multilingual-candidates-that-you-need/). LinkedIn have the right idea, breaking language proficiency into conversational and business proficiency. Just because someone can make basic conversation in a second language, that does not mean they have the language skills to make a sale or to discuss technical terms.

One straightforward way of assessing the language skills of a candidate is to involve bilingual candidates in the interview process. By assessing language skills early in the process, you can eliminate unsuitable candidates. This makes the screening process more systematic and effective.

#### Advertising

[How you advertise](http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/writing-effective-job-advertisement-tips/) makes an awful difference when seeking bilingual candidates. Clarifying what exactly is required from the prospective bilingual employee will greatly impact the kind of candidates that you will attract. Ensure to communicate the level of proficiency required. If native-level Spanish is required, state that clearly in any job postings.

This might seem too obvious to state, but make sure that you are advertising in the language of the candidates you hope to attract. If you do not have the resources or budget to translate your job postings into multiple languages, consider translating just the headline, to catch the eye of the candidates you want.

> Make sure that when your advertising for multilingual jobs, that you must remain compliant with the labour laws of the target country

Make sure that when your advertising for multilingual jobs, that you must [remain compliant with the labour laws of the target country](http://recruitingdaily.com/global-recruiting-hire-job-candidates-abroad/). By doing a bit of research about the target country’s laws, you will be able to avoid any mishaps. This will also make you far more in tune with the cultural sensitivities of the country, again making your advertising more effective.

Make sure you understand the labour laws [regarding discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/), as what may be perfectly acceptable requirements to add to an advertisement in your country, may be impermissible in another culture.

The same consideration should be taken when handling applications. Again you should ensure that you are keeping in line with the expectations of the country you are advertising in. Don’t request information that is not legally permitted in the jurisdiction in question.

Interviewing candidates not resident in the country you are working in can pose a bit of a challenge. Leveraging tools like video interviewing or screening can give the recruiting process a personal touch, without needing to charter a flight to get your candidates to you.
