As the world takes a step back trying to wrap its collective head around the current global health crisis, the economy everywhere is facing a new reality. Some companies aren’t engaging in business at all, but when things return to normal the upswing in new hires will be fast and furious. There’s no better time than now to turn inward for learning recruitment ideas and techniques that you can bring back to the table when business resumes. What are the top 10 must-read books for standardizing your recruitment process? Let’s take a closer look.

### 1) Making the most out of Technology and Data

- **[Recruiting in the Age of Googlization: When the Shift Hits Your Plan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37663876-recruiting-in-the-age-of-googlization)** **by Ira Wolfe**

Wolfe has years of experience with recruiting and his TEDx Talks showcase his expertise. But his book talks about how technology is disrupting recruiting. Specifically, he explores people analytics driven by companies like Google. To embrace the future of recruitment, embracing data will be imperative.

- **[The Talent Delusion: Why Data, Not Intuition, Is the Key to Unlocking Human Potential](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33959455-the-talent-delusion)** **by Thomas Chamorro-Premuzic**

We have to be honest with ourselves. Recruiting, for a long time, was driven by intuition. But in today’s data-driven economy, that may not provide us with the best solutions. To drive the new economy, and improve your recruitment strategy, recognizing how data and technology can help improve the industry is going to benefit us all.

- **[The Robot-Proof Recruiter: A Survival Guide for Recruitment and Sourcing Professionals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43289624-the-robot-proof-recruiter?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=osUkIXF0A1&rank=1)** **by Katrina Collier and Shannon Pritchett**

Is a recruiter’s job really at risk from artificial intelligence? While AI can enhance the recruiting profession, it will be impossible to replace the human touch in every aspect. This book provides the tools a recruiter needs to make themselves an integral part of the entire recruiting process.

### 2) Finding the right talent

- **[The Consultative Recruiter: The Key to Faster Fills, More Candidates and Happier Hiring Managers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24252938-the-consultative-recruiter?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=TNAxeoWtdl&rank=1)** **by Katherine Moody**

Of course, if data is the only driver of new recruitment strategies, you’ll miss out on another important aspect. Not only is recruiting a type of client services, but staffing agencies and recruiters also need to be partners to the companies they work with. The book showcases strategies to reduce the time to hire and better collaboration with hiring managers.

- **[How to Interview People: A Guide to Choosing the Best Person for the Job Every Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37798336-how-to-interview-people?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=RbAZ8GqAUD&rank=1)** **by Heike Guilford**

Even with data driving the industry, recruiters still need to talk to candidates to make the best selections for their clients. This book features exercises that can help you put the work into practice immediately. It’s great not only for entry-level recruiters but to refresh information for those who have been in the industry for a long time.

- **[Revolutionary Recruiting: How the Faremouth Method Helps Job Seekers, Recruiters, and Businesses Learn to Match People with Their Passions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36287730-revolutionary-recruiting?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=4AyQIWcxnl&rank=1)** **by Mary Ann Faremouth**

Faremouth posits that if recruiters rely too much on the resume itself, they can make grave mistakes trying to match employees to jobs. She’s created a method that, as she says, “gets under the hood” of resumes to help recruiters make the right matches, not just any placement.

- **[Lean Recruitment: Finding Better Talent](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36582345-lean-recruitment?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=fDk2ObNEFg&rank=1)** **by Gary Romano**

This book goes over the potential pitfalls of hiring the wrong person. While it is geared toward the hiring manager as the primary audience, recruiters need to understand the fears and concerns of their client companies when they’re making a placement.

### 3) The future of the recruitment industry

- **[Social Media Recruitment: How to Successfully Integrate Social Media Into Recruitment Strategy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23368015-social-media-recruitment?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=p55HR2CpPa&rank=1)** **by Andy Headworth**

We would do a disservice by not including a resource on social media just for the recruitment industry. Why? Social Media is changing the way we connect with everyone, and it is going to be an important tool for a long time. But that doesn’t mean all social media strategies are one size fits all. This book provides guidelines.

- **[The Future Workplace Experience: 10 Rules for Mastering Disruption in Recruiting and Engaging Employees](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29512717-the-future-workplace-experience?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2BXXVQo2Za&rank=1)** **by Jeanne C. Meister and Kevin Mulcahy**

It helps to look toward the future to better understand how various trends and technologies will disrupt recruiting and what staffing firms can do about it. It gives recruiters a path to seek out these trends and meet them head-on so they don’t get left behind when things shift dramatically.

- **[Culture-Driven Recruiting: There’s No Talent War if You Eliminate the Competition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42839320-culture-driven-recruiting?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=QhDl7eR0GN&rank=1)** **by Lee-Anne Edwards**

Her book is a call to action for those in the industry who want to be disrupters. If you shrug off the idea that “it’s always been done this way,” this book can help you expand your horizons and become a competitive recruiter in a modern world.

In the future of recruiting, we also believe that standardization will come in the form of useful online tools to help source and hire only the very best candidates. Do you want to learn more? [Contact the team](mailto:hello@hirehive.com) at HireHive today.
