I do not mean to alarm you, but you may be losing candidates. You may be posting your new roles and pursuing your preferred candidates with good results, but do you ever wonder what might have been? What if your dream candidate got frustrated halfway through the application process? Sigh.

Do avoid a 90s throwback to the film _Sliding Doors_ in recruiting terms and abide by the following tips in your next recruiting project.

> If your application process is cumbersome or difficult to complete, you are likely to lose candidates at the application stage

#### **Application process**

This one seems to get on many people’s nerves. If your application process is cumbersome or difficult to complete, you are likely to lose candidates at the application stage. This one is particularly problematic, as you lose candidates at the very first stage of the process.

To remedy this, think about ways you can streamline your application process. Are you asking questions in the most efficient way possible? Is your process easy to use? Are you asking questions about career experience as well as asking for a CV upload? [HireHive](http://hirehive.io) allows you to create a careers site and application process, so you can easily avoid these pitfalls.

#### **Poor communications**

Yet another pet peeve of candidates. This is another very easy way to frustrate your candidates and [lose their interest](http://hirehive.io/blog/candidate-experience-101/). Many candidates do not even receive an automated response from the application process… yup, I can imagine that is probably quite annoying.

By keeping up steady contact with candidates, you will assure them that your organisation in keenly interested, which will in turn keep them interested. HireHive allows you to maintain contact with your candidates, as well as keeping all contact neatly stored in the candidates’ profiles.

> If the process goes on too long, your candidates will simply go elsewhere

#### **Slow hiring**

Closely related to the previous point is the issue of slow hiring. Sometimes, this cannot be avoided, but if you act too slowly, you may lose your candidates to another organisation. If the process goes on too long, your candidates will simply go elsewhere.

To avoid this, consider using an [ATS](http://hirehive.io/online-applicant-tracking/). By using recruiting software, you will considerably reduce your time to hire and cost per hire. When you meet unavoidable road-stops, by having recruiting software at your disposal, you will be able to maintain contact and interest.

#### **Job titles or description**

To engage the candidates you want, you have to make your needs as an organisation abundantly clear. [Effective job postings](http://hirehive.io/blog/are-creative-job-postings-the-key-to-sourcing-top-candidates/) and descriptions are key to getting responses from suitable candidates.

If you unintentionally mislead candidates, whether by putting off suitable candidates by not stating your needs or by encouraging unsuitable candidates, it will lead to frustration. A good solution is sitting down with your hiring team and looking at the skill set required.

#### **Website not up to date or old information**

Say a candidate happens upon your site. They see a posting that fits with their skills set and they were considering a change. They spend time filling out an application and update their CV. The next thing they hear from your organization is that that posting is months old and the job has already been filled.

This is a very frustrating situation to encounter for candidate and recruiter. Avoid this by simply keeping your site up to date and removing any postings that are filled.
