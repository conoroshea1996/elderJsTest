In case you haven’t heard, the global tech giant Google released a new job application service called [Google Hire](https://hire.withgoogle.com/sign-in?next=%2F). Similar to LinkedIn, Google Hire will allow employers to create job ads and manage applications through the product. It will also allow job seekers to search and apply for jobs.

At the moment, the main screen of Google Hire is visible to anyone, but the rest is hidden. You can’t log in either (trust me I tried). While information regarding this new tool is sparse, what do we think so far? What are the pros and cons?

#### **Pro: Experts in data**

Google has a variety of products that already collect [data](https://qz.com/969114/googles-new-jobs-product-could-benefit-from-everything-else-google-knows-about-you/) about what people search across the internet. This data may be used to better match companies to potential candidates. Candidates may also be exposed to a wider variety of companies with Google’s advanced [search](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/google-to-launch-a-jobs-search-engine-in-the-u-s/?ncid=rss) capability.

#### **Pro: A partner, not a villain**

As opposed to overthrowing job boards, Google has said it will take in job listings from Monster, LinkedIn and Facebook. This shows that Google is more interested in partnering with existing job boards, as opposed to annihilating them. It also means that job seekers will still get a full view of what jobs are available.

#### **Pro: Advanced filters**

Google Hire will have a number of [tools](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/google-to-launch-a-jobs-search-engine-in-the-u-s/?ncid=rss) to help job seekers find the right role. For example, you’ll be able to filter jobs by location, title, category or type, date posted or whether the jobs are full or part-time, among other things.The service will also show applicants things like commute time, to help them figure out if the job is too far away to consider.

#### **Con: Privacy issues**

Much like Facebook’s job posting tool, Google Hire has sparked fears about [privacy](https://www.rt.com/viral/385064-google-hire-browsing-history/). The product’s sign in page has an option to connect through a personal Google account, which has ignited fears that employers could see your search history and Youtube subscriptions. As the product is still in its early days, it is unclear what employers will see when searching for new hires.

#### **Con: Online Support**

Not to be cruel, but has anyone ever tried to contact Google regarding any problem with their products? 95% of the time you don’t get a response. While I’m sure Google Hire will be a versatile and simple tool, Google will need to address their online support structure in line with the new product.

#### **Con: Speciality**

Google may be experts in data and advertising, but this doesn’t mean they are experts in everything, including the jobs market. Senior executives at job boards [agree](https://qz.com/969114/googles-new-jobs-product-could-benefit-from-everything-else-google-knows-about-you/), with Indeed’s president saying:

> “The most important thing in any business is, what is your primary focus? We have no competing interests here around other businesses, advertising revenue, not other products.”

This comment suggests that Indeed feel far from threatened by Google’s vested interest in the jobs market, as Indeed focus on one thing, while Google focuses on many.
