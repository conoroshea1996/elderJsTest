_Email has long been established as the primary tool for managing job postings and applications, but could we do better? Recruiting software, like HireHive offers more effective and uncomplicated means of communicating with candidates._

Maintaining communication with candidates is essential to successful recruitment. If candidates feel you have been attentive and transparent through the recruitment process, that goes a long way in improving candidate experience and employee retention. Recruiting software can help.

For many, email is the main tool used for keeping in contact with candidates, which can be a hot mess. I’m certain the experience of fumbling through CVs and trying to match them to emails from candidates is universal. Or desperately making the most vague searches in your inbox, because you think you remember getting an application from someone with software development experience.

> No more switching from spreadsheets, to PDFs of CVs, to job postings, then... to your email inbox.

Though the advantages that recruiting software offers over email are many, these five should be enough to convince you.

#### **1\. Sharing is easier**

If you’re away, there’s no need to worry about candidates being ignored. HireHive offers control over who has access to what, so your colleagues will be able to respond to your candidates in the event you’re not able to.

Where your email inbox may be password-protected, recruiting software makes sharing the workload so much easier. You can share comments or additional notes on candidates with your colleagues.

#### **2\. Making it more human**

There’s nothing more soulless than a ‘Dear Candidate’ [automatic response](http://tcgen.com/is-your-recruiting-process-damaging-your-brand/#.Vq6Ks_mLTIU). Using recruiting software, you can eliminate this. You can prepare templates that are exactly the response you would [like to give](http://www.newsweek.com/career/job-application-auto-response-will-actually-make-you-happy). While email offers this option, using HireHive, you can populate templates with a candidate’s details, giving a personal touch. Just because it’s automation software, doesn’t mean you need to take the human element out.

#### **3\. All in one place**

One of the very obvious advantages of using recruiting software, over email, is that everything is in one place. No switching from spreadsheets, to PDFs of candidate’s CVs, to job postings, to your email inbox. Just one clean, straight-forward overview of candidate information and correspondence. Having information at hand improves accuracy, reduces man-hours and offers a much more streamlined workflow.

#### **4\. Archiving**

An archive of all communications between yourself and your candidates is another useful advantage of using tools like HireHive. No candidate questions or responses will get lost in the ether, as correspondence is logged according to applicant.

Never again will you be searching your inbox, trying to figure out if your candidate has a masters in macro or microeconomics. Another advantage HireHive offers is the possibility to manage internal referrals. No missed opportunities and no awkward conversations in the canteen, because you accidentally overlooked your colleague’s nephew’s CV. Oops.

#### **5\. Marathon report runner**

While email just funnels applications into your inbox, recruiting software is double-jobbing, gathering data on applications and running clear reports for you to review.

Rather than giving someone the pitiable job of compiling data on applicant sources, volumes and views, HireHive is taking one for the team, doing the job for you… and compiling reports… and giving you the option to export to a spreadsheet. Just cause it’s cool like that. It does just stop short of getting you a cup of coffee and a biscuit from the canteen, but we all need something to aspire to. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
