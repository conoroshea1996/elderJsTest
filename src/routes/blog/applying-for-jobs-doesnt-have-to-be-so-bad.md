Applying for jobs can be pretty tough, so as a recruiter you must do all you can to make it easy on the candidate. If your candidate has a [good experience](https://hirehive.com/blog/good-candidate-experience-secret-happy-hire/) from the beginning to the end of the recruiting process, there is a much greater likelihood of making a hire.

So what can you do to make applying for jobs as painless is possible? Well using recruiting software is one easy step, but here are another few to bear in mind.

#### **Forms and assessments**

There is no greater frustration than a lengthy, repetitive form when applying for jobs.  Sometimes it feels like you might never get to the end of an application. By having a straightforward form, CV upload option and basic competency assessment, you make the process easier for the candidate. Make it easy for the candidate to know what you are looking for.

> #### **Communication**

[Communication is key.](http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/contact-candidates-dos-donts/) One of the greatest disservices an organisation can do is not to reply to an application. Imagine the frustration of going through a lengthy application and not even receiving an automated response to let you know it was received? Recruiting software can make the job of contacting successful and unsuccessful candidates efficient, as well as easy.

> #### **Careers site**

A careers site makes understanding a role and an organisation so much easier for an applicant. It becomes a one-stop-shop for understanding an organisation's values, ambitions, benefits and trajectory. More importantly, it is where many candidates will make an application. HireHive allows you to create a custom careers site that can be integrated with your existing site.

> #### **Feedback**

If a candidate has been unsuccessful in their application, the least that you should offer them is feedback. It is a pretty simple way of ensuring a positive candidate experience and potentially making a future hire. HireHive’s scorecard feature makes this very simple, as you have feedback ready to offer candidates.

> #### **Referrals**

[Employee referrals](https://hirehive.com/blog/is-an-employee-referrals-program-the-most-effective-way-to-recruit/) are great for both recruiter and candidate. For candidates, an application through a referrals program is simple. For recruiters, employee referrals are an assured way of getting quality applicants, with higher rates of retention and lower cost to hire. All this really requires is the implementation of a referral program.

> #### **Job boards and social media**

Usability of application tools is very significant. If the process requires creating logins or accounts, the process becomes frustrating. How do you avoid this? Engage with applicants using platforms they already use. Online recruiting software like HireHive allows you to post job ads to a variety of social media platforms and job boards.

> #### **Interviewing**

Interviews are often the toughest part of the recruiting process for candidates. Interviews are a source of unnecessary stress, but this need not be the case. Recruiting software like HireHive helps you schedule phone and in-house interviews, sending personalised invites to candidates.
