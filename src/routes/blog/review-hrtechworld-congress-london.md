One of the fastest growing global HR events globally, [HRTechWorld Congress](https://twitter.com/HRTechWorld), this year found itself in London. The event takes stock of the current standing of HR technology and where the area is going. Drawing speakers and companies from all across the HR and recruiting world, the event looks at the most current, disruptive technologies on the market. Well, what went down this year?

#### Day 1

[Simon Sinek](https://mobile.twitter.com/simonsinek), the man whose TED talk is touted as the [3rd most watched](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) on TED.com, was always going to be a point of intrigue. Known for his theories on topics ranging from leadership to motivation, this time his point of focus was on trust, leadership and the responsibility of those in charge. He focused in on the duty of a leader: “As a leader, you're not responsible for the results, you're responsible for the people responsible for the results.”

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We call people leaders because they are first to step into danger and the unknown - how true is this in business? <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsinek">@simonsinek</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HRTechWorld?src=hash">#HRTechWorld</a> — <a href="https://twitter.com/david_green_uk/status/709676338433691649">David Green (@david_green_uk)</a></p></blockquote>

Top HR Analyst, as well as founder of Bersin by Deloitte, [Josh Bersin](https://mobile.twitter.com/Josh_Bersin) took his [analytical and research skills](http://searchfinancialapplications.techtarget.com/news/4500278397/Golden-age-of-HR-predictive-analytics-on-horizon-report-says) to present the 10 most profound and disruptive trends shaping the HR technology market. He brought up the problem of a lack of feedback and noted that people thrive on this. Also discussed were the failings of L&D within organisations and how it fails to match up with how people actually learn. Telling it like he sees it.

[Peter Hinssen](https://mobile.twitter.com/hinssen) asked how can we adopt network thinking into our organisations to keep ahead of the curve and quickly? Nexxworks founder Hinssen is known for disruptive thinking and his presentation was no different. He focussed on the need to constantly “think like a start-up” and innovate.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"You can't sell to HR like you can sell to tech." That's why we keep getting screwed. <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshBersin_">@JoshBersin_</a> be a part of the solution. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HRTechWorld?src=hash">#HRTechWorld</a></p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcharney/status/709695514476998656">Matt Charney (@mattcharney)</a></blockquote>

#### Day 2

[Jason Averbook](https://mobile.twitter.com/jasonaverbook): Averbook reckons we're headed for a perfect storm in workforce technology, so he wants us to tug on our wellingtons and waders to weather that storm. He pointed, rather strikingly, to the fact that LinkedIn (and consequently competitors)  has more information on people than the organisations that employ them. There’s a rumble of thunder if ever I heard one.

Lastminute.com founder [Martha Lane-Fox](https://mobile.twitter.com/Marthalanefox) delivered this years keynote on internet being the organising principle of our age. Like Hinssen, she focussed on the significance of networked thinking. Later in conversation with Anne Marie Tomchak, she took questions from the audience.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HRTechWorld?src=hash">#HRTechWorld</a> "96% of global software engineers are men, 90% of venture capitalist backers are men" stark observation from <a href="https://twitter.com/Marthalanefox">@Marthalanefox</a></p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/MervynDinnen/status/710115999178162177">MervynDinnen (@MervynDinnen)</a></blockquote>

She really honed in on the under-representation of women in the digital sector, with women [only making up 17%](https://www.thetechpartnership.com/globalassets/pdfs/research-2015/womeninit_scorecard_2015.pdf). She believes that companies that fully embrace diversity will be the winners in the future world of work.
