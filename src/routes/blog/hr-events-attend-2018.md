_With so many HR and recruiting events going on in 2018, it may be tough to pick which ones to attend. Here's a quick shortlist of global events addressing the world of work in 2018._

Industry events and conferences offer attendees a fantastic opportunity to learn of new trends, technology and potential challenges in the world of human resource management, as well as the opportunity to meet your colleagues and peers.

#### Unleash

_London, 20th-21st March; Las Vegas, 15th-16th May; Amsterdam, 23rd-24th October_

[Unleash](http://www.unleashgroup.io/news/) has a growing reputation and a global presence, so it would be a shame to miss one of their many events this year. Unleash are hosting events in London, Amsterdam and Las Vegas. Though the full line-up of speakers has yet to be announced for all of this year's events, past speakers have been enormously impressive, including Richard Branson, Ariana Huffington and Simon Sinek.

#### Deloitte IMPACT 2018: The rise of the individual in the future of work

_Florida, 3rd-6th April_

[IMPACT](http://ops.deloitteconference.com/impact2018) is now in its eleventh year and in that time has become an industry leading conference. Deloitte HR experts Bersin are behind this event. This year the conference is focussed on the power of the individual in the workplace of the future. The conference is very much forward-looking, covering topics from the future of work to HR tech and tools.

#### DisruptHR

_Various locations globally throughout the year_

[DISRUPT](https://disrupthr.co/) is not a conference as such, but an ongoing forum for discussion on the current state of human resource management and potential future trends. Events are held at various locations globally, organised by HR professionals in the area. It's a bit like a network of clubs or committees, ready to engage with the future of the working world.
