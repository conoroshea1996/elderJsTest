_A strong public image could do half your recruiting work for you. So how do you build a strong PR profile?_

PR is essential in attracting the right kind of candidates to your organisation. Communicating your message in the right way can help your overall recruiting message, by making your company’s culture understood. By making your company well understood, you can ensure the applications you are getting are from the right kind of candidates.

Building your PR profile is definitely part of the long game in your recruiting efforts. The image you need to present to the public should be authentic and representative of your company’s values. But how do you build up your company’s public image and present it to the right people?

#### Employees input matters

Your employees have a huge role to play in building your public image. [Employee referrals](https://hirehive.com/employee-referrals-team-can-help-you-grow/) are an essential part of the recruiting process and if your employees can present an exciting image of your organisation they can help attract top talent.

Social media, participation in industry events and networking events are just two ways that your employees can give an insight into what it is like to work at your organization. Your employees will be able to share an authentic and insightful description of what your company is really like.

#### Consider your mediums carefully

The mediums which you can employ to create your company’s public image are difficult to number. Traditional mediums, like print or industry events, have as much value as more contemporary platforms like social media. The key is to target the correct platforms for your industry and the type of candidate you would like to attract.

If you are seeking graduate-level candidates, newspaper features are not the right way of making yourself known to them. If you are looking for more senior staff, an extensive Snapchat campaign will not get you the right returns. The medium will say a lot about your organisation.
