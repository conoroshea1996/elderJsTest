Recruiting is a bit like a one way mirror, or a valve, or one of those turnstile things in the supermarket. In other words, recruiting can be one-sided. You may exchange emails with candidates, speak to them at interview stage, or they might request feedback on their application, but that’s it.

You may wonder what it would be like on the other team: to be an applicant or candidate. Their experience means an awful lot to your company brand and perceptions of your organisation, so it would be a fantastic insight to have.

Let’s live out the movie Freaky Friday: what if candidates could give feedback on their experience? Here are three areas you would be likely to get some strong opinions on.

#### **1\. Communication**

You probably guessed this one. If candidates were able to give feedback to a recruiter, communication would probably feature strongly. In fact, up to 34% of candidates seek more communication in the recruitment process. This is understandable, as we can all empathise with the frustration of not getting a response to an email or a voicemail. Up to [70% of candidates](http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2013/12/08/5-tips-for-a-winning-candidate-experience/#698f2db64b50) don’t even receive an automated response to a job application, so it’s a good idea to share as much information as appropriate with your candidate.

> A brief, simple means of getting particular information from an applicant is all you need

It is not always easy, but try to give even an approximate understanding of the timeline or decision process to the candidate. If that really isn’t possible, try to keep the candidate updated with a ‘no news’ email. On the other hand, if you want to reject a candidate, let them know via email. Also offer some kind of constructive feedback where possible.

#### **2\. Simplify the application process**

Again, this one is easy to empathise with. A convoluted process of application will only frustrate candidates. Up to 60% of candidates state that they would abandon a challenging job application. The application process should be straightforward, mobile optimised and accept alternative means of providing a CV (i.e. LinkedIn compatible). A brief, simple means of getting particular information from an applicant is all you need.

Even a short visual or video guide helping an applicant through the process will encourage them to follow through on the application process. Understanding the process will make someone more likely to participate in it. Recruiting software like HireHive can parse CVs, so there’s no need to ask candidates to enter the same information more than once.

#### **3\. Feedback**

In theory, this is a subset of communication, but in the eye of the job applicant, this is a point all of its own. It is challenging to offer candidates [feedback on their application or interview](http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/successful-candidate-feedback/), but it is one of the most widely cited frustrations about the job application process.

Making the hiring process as comfortable as possible for candidates will always reflect well on your organisation. You don’t need to stand on your head for each and every applicant you encounter, but simply keeping up with correspondence, as well as making any interaction with your organisation simple, will reflect your company’s brand and values. Keeping the experience of candidates in mind is well worth the effort.
