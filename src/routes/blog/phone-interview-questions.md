Phone interview questions are tough for recruiter and job-seeker alike, but they are often a necessary part of the recruiting process. By using phone screening, you can effectively narrow your pool of candidates from what your recruiting software has filtered, and get information that just cannot be gleaned from a CV.

When the process can be challenging for recruiter and candidate, what questions effectively and efficiently get you the information you need about your candidates?

#### **Question 1 - How would your manager describe you?**

It is all well and good for a candidate to say that they are motivated, hardworking, as well as an independent thinker. Many candidates will offer a similar view. Asking them to consider things from a different perspective may give a far clearer understanding of what their attitudes and skills are.

#### **Question 2 - What are skills you recently learned?**

Keeping up with the pace of industry is essential for longevity. You will definitely want any prospective colleagues to have this skill. By asking this, you will gain a good understanding of what their professional interests are and how they might fit in at your organisation.

#### **Question 3 - Why are you leaving your current role?**

This might feel like an uncomfortable question, but you need to understand why a candidate might be leaving their current job. It lets you know what their expectations might be of your organisation and if they will be a good fit. It is important that both you and the candidate are meeting somewhere in the middle.

> A CV or resume can offer a lot of information to a recruiter about a candidate. What it cannot offer information on is gaps

#### **Question 4 - Gaps in employment?**

A CV or resume can offer a lot of information to a recruiter about a candidate. What it cannot offer information on is gaps. There is no point in guessing or assuming what a candidate may have been doing in that time. It is best to ask as there may be a rational reason for the time not spent at work and it may benefit the organisation.

#### **Question 5 - Why do you want this role?**

Might as well get to the root of it. Again, it is a good way of gaining insight into the candidate’s motivations and expectations.

#### **Question 6 - When would you be free to interview?**

It’s good to get a few practical, logistics questions in there. Don’t forget, HireHive, compatible with Outlook, can be used to [schedule any interviews](http://hirehive.io/recruiting-features/).

#### **Question 7 - What's your typical day like?**

Another great way to find out if they have the skill set required for the role. It is also reassuring if they are able to rattle off a list of tasks they perform on a daily basis - that way you know they were doing something at least.

#### **Question 8 - What is your dream job?**

If they say it’s the one your advertising, you are onto a winner. If they go into detail about the kind of working environment and methods they prefer, better again. Culture match [means a lot](http://hirehive.io/blog/should-your-company-culture-change-your-approach-to-recruiting/).

> If a candidate can share this and their enthusiasm for their work, you know you’ve got a quality prospective employee

#### **Question 9 - What are your greatest accomplishments?**

Pride in a job well done is an unmistakeable feeling. If a candidate can share this and their enthusiasm for their work, you know you’ve got a quality prospective employee.

#### **Question 10 - What are your values?**

Culture and shared values are important in any organisation. Even more so if you’ve all got a job to do.
