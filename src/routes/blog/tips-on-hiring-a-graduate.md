Whether you're into using the vague (and possibly pejorative) term ‘[millennials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials)’ or good, old-fashioned ‘graduates,’ you're likely to be targeting this group as a recruiter.

The generation born in the late 80s and 90s will soon make up 50% of the workforce, so reaching this group as they leave college and university is pretty significant. This group is receptive to change or new opportunities, so appealing to them and retaining them as employees requires a slightly different approach.

The supposed challenge with recruiting recent grads is knowing how to communicate with them or understanding their values, but that could be said for any target group. Indeed, you might look at some of the following suggestions and say they're relevant for every generation. Here are a few key things to keep in mind, when appealing to graduates.

#### How to advertise

Recent grads are digital natives. They never knew a world without Internet access or mobile phones. They are often early adopters to new technologies. When advertising to graduates, you really have to keep this at the forefront of your mind. Graduates and students will exclusively search job postings online, so online job boards is the safest way to go.

Any job sites or application processes have to be mobile optimised, to ensure you're reaching them on their favoured medium. As stated already, recent grads are digital natives and they expect some level of sophistication in the job application process. As always, make sure that your job application process is straightforward and efficient.

#### Information overload

Students and grads grew up in a world of information overload, due to the accessibility of online resources. Sharing as much information about your organisation and any potential roles is essential to keep recent graduates interested. Make sure the hiring timeline or process is explained, so as not to discourage younger candidates. Leaving questions unanswered is one very easy way of frustrating a younger candidate.

#### Timing

The second week in June usually marks the beginning of what is known as the [student scramble](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/2015/06/22/6-top-employers-hiring-graduates-during-student-scramble). This is the time of the year that the majority of graduates will begin the job search in earnest. In order to beat the competition to get the top candidates, consider your timing carefully. Advertising in May, when students are knee deep in exams and assignments, is not the best idea, but leaving it too late makes you just one of dozens of organisations vying for their attention.

#### #Goals

Having a clear outline of what the role entails and likely career path, will help new graduates understand what is expected of them, and how to reach those targets.

Making this clear to a graduate, even at recruitment stage, will show your organisation to have vision and ambition. Sharing information on your training process also helps candidates to understand their place in the company. Again, today’s graduates like a lot of information, so any data you have to back this up will appeal to them.

#### Benefits

Candidates of any age are concerned about the values at an organisation they'd like to work for, but millennials highly prioritise meaning and value in their work. Flexibility and a good organisational culture are not just nice-to-haves for recent grads. Studies have shown that grads are willing to compromise on earnings to work for an organisation with an excellent workplace culture.

Millennials are capable multi-taskers and favour a challenge in the workplace. Make sure to let them know early on about performance review and how your organisation does this. Structure and valuing hard work are essential for a millennial work environment.
