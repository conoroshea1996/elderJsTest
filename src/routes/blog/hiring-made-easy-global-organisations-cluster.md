_Company growth is exciting and can provide new opportunities for your organisation. Making great new hires will help your company's reach, but how can HireHive Cluster help you do this?_

An exciting period of growth may see your organisation opening new office locations nationally or [internationally](https://hirehive.com/know-hiring-abroad/), which in turn may mean you need to hire quickly. If speed and efficiency are of the essence, it is unlikely that you will be able to set up a HR department at each location to manage your recruiting campaigns.

In cases like these, HireHive Cluster can help you to maintain visibility on all your recruiting projects, no matter the location. So what exactly can HireHive Cluster do to help your recruiting efforts across all your locations?

> No matter where you are recruiting or who is doing the recruiting, you have insight into your ongoing projects

#### **What is HireHive Cluster?**

Cluster is a new feature that lets you manage your recruiting campaigns at all of your company or franchise locations. No matter where you are recruiting or who is doing the recruiting, you have insight into your ongoing projects. This unified, comprehensive tool makes sure that all bases are covered.

It works like this: your company has one master account, which then has sub accounts for each of your locations or offices. The master user of the account has visibility on each of the sub accounts through a dashboard. It gives you an overview of all recruiting projects that your various teams and locations are managing through the sub accounts.

If you do not have a HR team onsite at a particular location, managing a recruiting project can be challenging. By having a master overview, you can give some of the responsibility of recruiting onsite, while remaining involved. Your [existing team](https://hirehive.com/employee-referrals-rewards-program/) in your other office locations will be acutely aware of your culture, values and needs, so even if the are not experienced recruiters their input is invaluable. As well as this, HireHive supports [multilingual recruiting](https://hirehive.com/recruiting-features/multilingual-hiring/).

As all recruiting projects are managed through HireHive, reporting and regulatory compliance in the territory you are recruiting in is easy. All candidates data is stored securely which is essential in light of the recent legal changes. Reports can be generated easily and you can ensure you remain compliant with local labour laws. Record keeping is probably the best way of ensuring this, so that all decisions made can be backed up with any data from your recruiting project.

HireHive’s screening tools and candidate profiles will even help you make informed decisions from afar. If you are hiring for roles abroad, the opportunity to meet your candidate in person may not crop up. With all information on your candidates close at hand, it is much easier to find the right match for your global team.
