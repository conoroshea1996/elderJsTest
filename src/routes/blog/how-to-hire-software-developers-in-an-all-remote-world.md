While 2020 has made remote work an organizational necessity, rather than a strategic choice, it is by no means a new phenomenon in the tech world. Candidates have been asking for years for the possibility to work remotely, part-time or full time.

If you’re looking to refocus your recruitment strategy towards remote, here are a few things to consider - from recruitment process to setup and long-term strategy.

#### An All-Remote Recruitment Process

To many companies, who are hiring international candidates, this is not a new concept. It is a tested strategy that has been proven to work well.

The first step is relatively straight forward - instead of onsite interviews, use video calls. While there are certainly drawbacks when it comes to establishing a personal connection, a survey by PGI found over [65% of candidates actually prefer video interviews](https://www.pgi.com/blog/2019/08/4-surprising-stats-that-show-the-true-impact-of-video-conferencing/).

Regarding technical assessment - many online tools (Codility, Hackerrank) give the possibility to administer a test online. An alternative is a virtual pair-programming session.

An applicant tracking system is an essential tool to keep an eye on the pipeline, schedule interviews and keep all feedback in an organized way. [HireHive](https://hirehive.com/) is a great example.

From our own experience, we have enabled companies to hire hundreds of engineers following a 100% remote recruitment process with huge success and close to 0% turnover.

#### Security and Setup

Spend some time planning the [process and tools you’re using for communication](https://www.zartis.com/remote-engineering-teams-what-weve-learned/), once people join. It’s important to set up the correct channels of communication, in which people feel included, valued and part of the decision making process. Some of the popular tools that can enable that include Slack, Microsoft Teams etc.

Consider the security needs and regulations you’re following - training around best practices and a VPN are a good starting point. Check out our blog post around [secure WFH](https://www.zartis.com/3-steps-into-secure-wfh/) for more details.

#### Payroll

This is applicable primarily if you’re hiring remotely outside of the country you’re already operating in. Anyone you hire needs to be legally set up as a B2B contractor or you can hire them through an outsourcing partner.

#### Hiring Directly vs Using a Nearshore Partner

And finally, depending on the scale you’re hiring at, consider whether hiring directly or using a partner would be the best solution for you.

If you’re able to find the talent you need in the country or countries you’re operating in, **hiring directly** would be the more suitable approach.

If you’re hiring internationally and at scale where you don’t have the bandwidth to deal with equipment, payroll, etc, another option for you is **nearshoring**. Choosing a partner, who can take care of all of this for you, can be very beneficial. At [Zartis](https://www.zartis.com/), we hire engineers to work long-term and exclusively for our clients, as an extension of their team, while we take care of everything from equipment to local compliance and regulations.
