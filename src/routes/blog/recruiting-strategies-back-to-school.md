For the recruiter, the summer months were all fun and games. Recruiting scaled down. Graduate recruiting was done and dusted. Key decision makers were on a yacht in the riviera somewhere. It was all a bit [Danny and Sandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oKPYe53h78), without the cramps.

Now the new term is about to begin at Rydell high, but you’ve found your backpack and you forgot your lunchbox was in there. You’ve got a summer science project due the first day back. You also embarrassed the school bully on the last day of term, so you know you’re in for it!

You're heading into Q4, and the recruiting team need to hit the ground running. You might have dozens of positions to advertise, interview for and ultimately fill in the coming months. Here’s a few tips to get the ball rolling.

#### Develop a plan

This one is probably stating the obvious, but it’s always worth reconsidering: what’s required? Having a plan will greatly help you to source, interview and shortlist candidates.

The remaining budget for the year should be utilised carefully, so where can the resources be best utilised? Working out what’s needed and how to hire the required candidates involves writing job ads, working out a short term hiring plan, determining key performance indicators, and picking out sourcing channels.

#### Go fishing in the talent pool

Having a teeming talent pool is always a great help. Approaching the busiest hiring phase of the year it’s great to be able to leverage work already done.

Candidates who may have previously been unsuccessful may still be interested in a similar role, so it’s worth reaching out to them again. You will have done much of the leg work in screening them already.

#### Automate

[Making use of online recruiting software](http://hirehive.io/blog/recruiting-software-small-businesses/) is a very wise move in a period of intense hiring. Now that recruiting has begun again in earnest and hires may need to be made by the end of September, you should be making use of a unified, automated tool.

Recruiting software helps with posting job ads, screening candidates, scheduling interviews and reporting. Getting all of those jobs done in one fell swoop is pretty helpful to the recruiting process and alleviates the pressure on your recruiting team. It makes the job of getting back to recruiting that bit easier.

#### Social media

Social media certainly speeds things up. If you need to hire quickly, [social recruiting tools](http://hirehive.io/blog/social-recruiting-tools/) are very useful in advertising jobs, as well as sourcing and screening candidates. Sourcing passive candidates is very effectively done using platforms such as LinkedIn or Twitter, giving a recruiter an insight into their career and interests.

Though branding is very much part of the long game, what you post to social media should tell the story of what your organisation hopes to achieve and what its values are.
