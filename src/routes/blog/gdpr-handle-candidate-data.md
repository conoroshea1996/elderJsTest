_The GDPR will ring in significant changes in how we handle personal data. But will using an ATS limit the impact on your organisation?_

The modern recruiting environment is nothing without data. This key part of your strategy and decision making process can help you transform the way you work. The data candidates share with you is invaluable to any recruiting project.

The way we handle data is highly significant. Personal data is of the utmost sensitivity and you should treat it in that way. The EU is about to introduce the GDPR that will enforce rules about the way you handle candidate data. So what is the GDPR and what will it mean for recruiting processes?

#### **What is** **the GDPR?**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the first major EU regulation on data protection since 1995. This [new legislation](http://www.eugdpr.org/the-regulation.html) will protect each individual’s data, providing regulation on how data can be used and stored. The legislation will be enforced from May 2018.

#### **What is changing?**

If handling a candidate’s information, you will need to have expressed permission from the candidate that you can use their data in the way you plan to. You will also need to store the personal data of any individual securely.

If your organisation is the victim of a security breach, you have a responsibility to inform any individuals of any data breaches. The GDPR will also enforce the right of any individual to be forgotten. If found in breach of the new regulations, an organization will face penalties for non-compliance.

#### **How this will** [**impact recruiting**](https://hirehive.com/gdpr-affect-recruiting-industry/)**?**

These changes will ensure that you store and use a candidate’s personal information in a way that they have consented to. For example, many organisations will hold onto a candidate’s information after a recruiting project, in case they prove suitable for any upcoming roles. In light of the new regulation, you would require expressed consent from a candidate to hold onto this data. As well as that, you would need to store that data securely.

#### **What do you need to do?**

You will need to be compliant with these new regulations, so you may need to change some of your processes and your IT infrastructure. You might even need to get renewed permission from individuals to handle their data. Furthermore, you will need to be able to trace when and how you obtained the data you have in your possession.

#### **How will the ATS change?**

If you are concerned about your recruiting software tools, [HireHive is already implementing changes](https://hirehive.com/eu-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/), ensuring that your recruiting software and recruiting practices are fully compliant with the new regulations. These changes will reduce the required effort of your recruiting team to an absolute minimum.

The advantage of an integrated tool like HireHive becomes clear in light of these changes. Where you store all candidate correspondence and information in one location, you need only make the improvements and changes in that one location.
