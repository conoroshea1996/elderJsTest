#### **Collaboration**

The most foolproof way to set up candidate feedback forms is through an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), like [HireHive](http://HireHive.io). This way, you can easily collaborate with the rest of your hiring team. Team members can customise the forms to suit any requirements they may have and offer their opinions on candidates.

We recommend that you set up your hiring team on your ATS early in the hiring process. This avoids confusion and keeps your hiring process as streamlined as possible. If you require feedback from an external source, Applicant Tracking Systems allow you to share a candidate's profile via email.

#### **Consistency**

When all hiring managers and recruiters use the same forms, this creates a sense of consistency and structure when hiring. If all hiring managers were evaluating candidates differently, this would make the overall hiring process more difficult.

As it is understandable that some roles may require particular skills or knowledge, feedback forms are fully customisable through an ATS. Depending on how many stages are in your interview process, you may want to add additional feedback forms.

> Should you wish to create your own feedback form, keep in mind it should be simple and to the point, especially when you request other people's time.

> #### **Evaluation**

The most important reason why you should use feedback forms is to evaluate everybody's thoughts on a candidate at each stage of the screening process. By keeping track of a candidate's strengths, weaknesses etc., there is no stone left unturned. Within [HireHive](http://HireHive.io), all feedback relating to a candidate is saved on their profile, meaning that all candidate information is available at any time.

It is also helpful to gather as many impressions as possible, as another team member may have noticed something about a candidate you didn't. Obtaining an external team member's perspective is also a good way of gaining more impressions. All of this ensures that you are making a well-informed decision about the candidate you choose to hire.

Overall, candidate feedback forms are ideal in guiding you through the hiring process. Using feedback forms through an ATS ensures that hiring is collaborative, consistent andÂ that you evaluate candidates thoroughly.
