A bad tradesman blames his tools… but it's a clever entrepreneur who takes any help they can get. The number of resources and tools available to startups are innumerable, so it would be unwise to overlook them.

Whether project management, HR, marketing or communications are among your needs, there's a handful of social media and recruiting tools to cater to everything. Here's a few that might just help you be a more efficient unicorn.

#### [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)

![recruiting tools](/images/recruiting-tools-7.jpg)

It's probably one of the most ubiquitous social media tools out there, but that's with good reason. You can post to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook all at once, all from one location, helping you reach as many people as possible, with minimal effort. Best of all, most of its major features are free, as well as being suited to browser and mobile.

#### [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

![recruiting tools](/images/recruiting-tools-2.jpg)

Visual marketing materials are always very attention grabbing and materials like infographics convey a huge amount of information in one glance. Canva is a free tool for the creation of graphics for recruiting marketing, which helps to create content for multiple platforms.

This is part of our [Social Recruiting](http://hirehive.io/social-recruiting/ "Social Media ") series

#### [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

![recruiting tools](/images/recruiting-tools-3.jpg)

Google Drive is already a fantastic way of collaborating on docs and sharing projects. One benefit Dropbox offers is the ability to merge changes, so that no one's work gets missed or overlooked.  It's also an effortless way to create backups.

#### [Google Analytics](https://www.google.ie/analytics/)

![social recruiting](/images/social-recruiting-5.jpg)

It might seem like I'm stating the obvious here, but the insight that analytics and data can offer cannot be underestimated. Again, it's a free tool that can revolutionise your approach to marketing.

#### [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/)

![recruiting tools](/images/recruiting-tools-4.jpg)

Yet another fantastic free tool. Email marketing is a little old school, but getting your name out there as a startup is essential to your success. Mailchimp can also be integrated with other tools so that you're getting the maximum out of all your resources.

#### [Slack](https://slack.com/)

![recruiting-tools-5](/images/recruiting-tools-5.jpg)

Another free product that can be integrated with other tools, Slack is a collaboration and communications solution.  It began life as an internal tool, which took on a life of its own, so you know it's good. Message your colleagues, archive materials and search the lot.

#### [Github](https://github.com/)

![recruiting tools](/images/github-recruiting-tools.jpg)

Another one that's strikingly obvious, but cannot go without being mentioned. While it's best known as a resource for coding, you can use it as a repository for source code and a means of collaboration.

#### [Trello](https://trello.com/)

![recruiting tools](/images/recruiting-tools-6.jpg)

Project management tools are always useful, with a wide range of applications across all your departments. Trello is a free, web-based tool that has an API, leaving it open to customisation and integration with other tools. You can split projects into boards and tasks into task lists.

#### [HireHive](http://hirehive.io/)

One of the biggest challenges a startup can face is keeping up with the rate of growth. Keeping up the staffing levels required is tough.[Recruiting software](http://hirehive.io/why-recruiting-software-could-change-the-way-you-recruit/) allows you to advertise job postings to a number of platforms, receive applications and communicate with candidates. Collaboration with colleagues is made simple, too, through the use of an online recruiting system.
