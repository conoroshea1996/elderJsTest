No only do you have to get the time right, but you have to get the very best out of that short time with a potential new hire. At the interviewing stage, you are down to the top 10 or so candidates out of all applicants. Here’s a few tips for making sure that you and your candidates get the best out of an interview.

#### Candidate experience

There's normally only one thing that candidates take away from the interviewing process, and that’s the thought “oh shoot! I forgot to mention that.” A candidate should not be taking away a poor impression of you or your organisation. You should respect a candidate's time when scheduling interviews.

Interviewing may require them to travel or even take time off from their current position, so balancing your time and theirs is the challenge you face. One idea is planning pre-interview time to review a candidate's CV one last time. It gives you a little extra buffer time between [interview schedules](https://hirehive.com/recruiting-features/interview-scheduling/) and prep time for the next. A good general guide is that an interview will take [40 minutes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/17/7-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-your-job-search/#2d8ff2fd64e6), so use that to schedule your time per candidate.

> Prep time gives you the opportunity to focus your interview, which will allow the candidate the best opportunity to express themselves and save you time

That little bit of prep time also gives you the opportunity to focus your interview, which will allow the candidate the best opportunity to express themselves and save you time. You should also avoid that dreaded ping pong of dates and times. Though you are likely to be busy, it's easier to go by the candidate’s free time.

#### And another thing

Avoid rescheduling as best you can. For the reasons highlighted above, among many others, it can be difficult for a candidate to make the time to see you, as much as they might want the role. Keeping appointments makes people feel valued and that's exactly the first impression you want when recruiting. If someone feels they're being squeezed in for the sake of it, it does not inspire confidence.

> Preparation will save you time, effort and potential embarrassment

#### Preparing to succeed

rom having a quiet space to interview, to having a pen and paper to write with, organise any necessary resources beforehand. At the risk of sounding like your former history teacher, if you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail. Preparation will save you time, effort and potential embarrassment. Have printed copies of CVs prepared for more effective note-taking.

Block book an interviewing room, if that is necessary in your office. If not, make sure to have a quiet corner is set aside for the interview period. If you need to incorporate a test or assessment into your interview, make sure you have a laptop or tablet available for use too.

#### Dividing your time

Getting the timing right is essential for getting the most out of your interviewing time. Try to sort interviews for a time of the day when you are most alert. Evenings or late afternoons are probably a universal no. We’ve all found ourselves putting sugar packets into the canteen fridge or addressing emails to Ms John Smith when it hits the 4 pm mark. Best leaving [interviews for earlier](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-best-and-worst-times-to-schedule-an-interview) in the day.

Along with block booking rooms, you’ll have to make sure that the relevant hiring managers or staff members are free on the days you plan on interviewing. A shared calendar, using tools like Google Calendar is a universal solution to such problems.

In addition to making sure they are free, have a meeting beforehand setting out your objectives and going through the job description/job requirements once more. You should also whittle down to 10 or so top candidates to interview. This way, you give the best of candidates the time to stake their claim.

The hiring process is very heavily influenced by interviewing. It’s essential to get it right, so as not to slow the hiring process. Getting it wrong means greater expense, time and pressure on other employees. A little bit of organisation and planning before, as well as during, the interview process makes a world of difference.
