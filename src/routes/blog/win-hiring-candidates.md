Everyone loves a bit of competition. We all pick up speed on the footpath to overtake other pedestrians. We all love it when our kids get better grades at school than our friends’ progeny. There’s nothing better than spotting the last parking space at the shopping centre. It’s only human to thrive on a bit of competition and why should it be any different when competing against other organisations for top candidates?

> To beat the competition for sought-after candidates, you need to utilise all tools available to you and research extensively

In the face of a bit of healthy competition, we know that it’s creativity and a comprehensive approach that will ensure that victory is yours. To beat the competition at hiring candidates, you need to utilise all tools available to you and research extensively. Here’s a few ways you might get the satisfaction of beating the competition to a top candidate.

#### Know your enemy

One smart move is researching your competition. Knowing what competitive edge similar organisations have, whether there is compensation, benefits or company culture, is extremely enlightening. It’s good to understand the market and what’s available to prospective candidates, as well as understanding where your organisation might need to up its game.

You don’t need to be [overly aggressive](http://www.eremedia.com/ere/opposition-research-provides-a-competitive-advantage-in-recruiting-and-retention/) in your research of the opposition - you don’t need to hang out in the shrubbery or dig through rubbish bins – you just need to understand what similar organisations can offer candidates. It will improve your ability to appeal to candidates, as well as improving retention of existing employees.

This is part of our [Recruiting Strategy](http://hirehive.io/recruiting-strategy/ 'Recruiting Strategy') series

#### Counter strike

What’s any team, in any sport, without its defence? You should be able to counter anything the opposition throws at you. In recruiting, this is easily achieved by giving an insight into your company and culture, through effective marketing. Your strength can be easily demonstrated to potential candidates. One easy way of doing this? Social media.

> Get your whole team involved in your social media strategy and in doing so, you’ll give interested candidates a strong insight into what your whole organisation is about

An integrated social media approach is always sensible. Get your whole team involved in your social media strategy and in doing so, you’ll give interested candidates a strong insight into [what your whole organisation is about](http://hirehive.io/blog/why-branding-and-recruiting-go-hand-in-hand/). One particularly effective strategy is “day in the life” posts and videos will help candidates to understand the roles on offer.

#### Don’t believe what Elon Musk might tell you, the machines are on your side

If you’re a teacher's pet worth your salt, you’ll always have the right answers and all the facts at your disposal. [Online recruiting software](http://hirehive.io/blog/hiring-software-pricing/) is one way of achieving this in the sphere of recruiting. You can receive applications, post jobs, keep up correspondence with candidates and schedule interviews.

Keeping up consistent contact and maintaining secure records on your candidates will give you the edge in appealing to potential candidates. If you keep up a good level of contact and appear to have your research done, candidates will be mightily impressed with your performance. With all the work done, you can just concentrate on being contentedly smug in your success.
