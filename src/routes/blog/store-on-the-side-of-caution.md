Last Monday, the European Commission and US Department of Justice released the text of their new “Privacy Shield” agreement. Designed to replace the [recently rejected](http://hirehive.io/any-port-in-a-storm-eu-data-privacy-in-a-post-safe-harbour-world/) Safe Harbour framework, it’s already under fire from critics claiming that it offers even less protection than its’ predecessor.

With no clear safeguards against bulk surveillance and usage of private data – there are [six](http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/PA_PS.pdf) broad-reaching categories within which the US can sidestep EU standards – campaigner Max Schrems says Privacy Shield is “Far from what the European Court of Justice (ECJ) required and does not seem like a stable solution.”

> Any data HireHive collects is done so in complete compliance with EU and Irish data protection requirements.

If you’re wondering what that ECJ requirement is, it’s that any law permitting public authorities to have general access to the content of electronic communications “must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life.”

#### Now what?

If your business involves gathering, processing or storing the personal data of EU citizens, you’re probably already familiar with the principles of fair use, security and other requirements around preserving candidate privacy. So is Hirehive…

Not only is our software is developed with ‘privacy by design’ principles in mind, we’ve taken all steps necessary to ensure that any data we collect is done so in complete compliance with EU and Irish data protection requirements.

That’s the data _we_ collect. When it comes to the data our customers store with us, the same principles of ‘privacy first’ apply. All data is stored on Microsoft Azure servers in Dublin, in Ireland. Not only do we take every possible step to ensure that that data is properly secured, we don’t transfer any of it outside the EU.

> Store your data on the side of caution, in a jurisdiction you know guarantees absolute privacy for personal data.

For added peace of mind, it’s worth noting that Microsoft’s Azure services comply fully with the EU’s strict regulations regarding data transfers outside the EU. This involves significant additional safeguards to ensure that privacy is always maintained.

#### Location, location, location

The worldwide web made geography largely irrelevant when it comes to communications, commerce or even where and how people work. But that kind of openness means privacy has never mattered more to people than it does now.

Instead of worrying about how certain kinds of legislation could work out, why not store on the side of caution, in a jurisdiction you know guarantees absolute privacy for personal data?
