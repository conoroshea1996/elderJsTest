What is the best indicator of how a potential candidate will behave in the role? The greatest insight into their past performance? What can tell you how they might react in a high-pressure situation? One simple way of finding all of this out is by including [behavioural questions](https://www.thebalance.com/use-a-behavioral-interview-to-select-the-best-employees-1918485) in your interview process.

Behavioural interview questions can offer a broad insight into the candidate’s capabilities, from teamwork to leadership, adaptability to communication. Though people argue that they can be too predictable for candidates, their value is undeniable. Here are a few things to consider when incorporating behavioural interview questions in the recruiting process:

> Your questions should seek real-world examples, rather than what a candidate might do

#### **Hypothetical questions**

Hypothetical questions are for when you want to distance yourself from the silliness of the question. That is just one of many reasons why you should avoid hypothetical behavioural questions. They do not question the proven experience of the candidate and may even lead the candidate in the wrong direction in an interview situation.

Your questions should seek real-world examples, rather than what a candidate might do - a textbook answer does not always work in practice. Even if the examples provided by a candidate are not from the work, they have proven themselves capable.

#### **Keep it general**

You may have specific, workplace-relevant situations in your mind, but avoid having too many moving parts. A very specific question may unnecessarily throw a candidate, where they in fact have a suitable response. A more high-level question gives a candidate scope.

High level questions will allow you to get an understanding of general skill sets and motivations. Whatever form that the candidate's experience comes in will reveal itself by general questions about their capabilities.

> You will have to understand what you need to ask and why before including this mode of questioning in your recruiting process

#### **Work out a strategy**

Asking questions about experience and aptitude is an extremely effective strategy,  but it can easily be rendered useless without some kind of plan. Before advertising the role, you will likely work out a list of core required skills and experience. By analysing this, you will be able to select [suitable behavioural questions](https://hirehive.com/blog/behavioural-interview-avoiding-mis-hire/).

You will have to understand what you need to ask and why before including this mode of questioning in your recruiting process. Once you understand this, you will be able to assess the candidate more effectively in the interview.

#### **Standardise**

Like any aspect of the recruiting process, the interview should be a level playing field. A standardised approach is required - every candidate should be presented with the same set of questions. By holding candidates to the same standard, the top candidate will clearly shine through.

That said, ensure that you analyse the candidate's CV and application carefully so that you can assess their specific skill set. The candidate may be lacking in one area, but may be able to demonstrate aptitude despite this. By having standardised criteria, you can implement strategies like using [scorecards](https://hirehive.com/blog/candidate-scorecards/), which recruiting software like HireHive will help you put together.
