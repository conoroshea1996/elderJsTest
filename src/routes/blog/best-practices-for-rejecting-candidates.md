Rejecting candidates is horrible. You will have built a good relationship with candidates through the recruiting process, so rejecting them is tough. Letting them down easy and giving them feedback is the best way of ensuring a continued good relationship and is essential for your [employer brand](https://hirehive.com/building-employer-brand-recruiting/).

> The difference between a positive and negative experience is pretty black and white for recruiter as well as candidate

The difference between a positive and negative experience is pretty black and white for recruiter as well as candidate. But what makes the biggest difference to candidate experience? A simple set of do's and don’ts, coupled with the help of recruiting software, will help you with rejecting candidates.

#### **Letting candidates know**

**What you should do:** Let candidates know [as soon as possible](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-turn-down-job-applicants-right-1918795) if you are not continuing with their application. A timely response ensures that you part on good terms and a candidate will not become frustrated. Recruiting software makes communication with candidates very efficient.

**What not to do:** Do not leave a candidate waiting. Sometimes you can't avoid this, so if a candidate makes their own follow up inquiries, do not ignore them. Respond in the same way as a regular rejection call.

#### **How you tell them**

**No bueno:** Not sending any kind of response. This is the worst. If you are sending a response, avoid sending a letter or email. An impersonal “Dear applicant” stock email is as bad as no email.

**Bueno:** A call is probably the best way of rejecting candidates. It is personal, respectful and you and your candidate can part on good terms. A personal touch makes a candidate feel that you carefully considered their application and reflects the work you put into processing it.

#### **What to tell them?**

**Never:** Avoid giving little detail to your applicants. Be very careful about how you formulate your response and don't allow room for ambiguity or misunderstanding. If a candidate even thinks that they have been discriminated against, the process has gone wrong somewhere.

**Always:** Give a candidate some kind of constructive feedback on their application. It can be pretty frustrating if you get a basic no and it can be difficult to understand what was good or bad about their application.

> Parting on good terms is essential for a combination of reasons

#### **Candidate experience**

**10/10 would recommend:** Parting on good terms is essential for a combination of reasons. Ensuring your candidate had [a positive experience](https://hirehive.com/blog/good-candidate-experience-secret-happy-hire/) with your company makes it easier to approach them again if a suitable role comes up. As well as that, they will share their experiences with other passive candidates.

**0/10 no way:** Set realistic expectations for your candidates. Do not string them along nor reject them too harshly. As stated above, the word will spread quickly if a candidate has a negative experience, which hampers future recruiting efforts.

#### **Record keeping**

**Bad idea:** Keeping inadequate records of your recruiting projects is a very bad idea. If you do not keep note of why candidates were hired or rejected, you may place yourself in a precarious legal position. Should you be investigated by any employment authorities, you do not have a leg to stand on without records.

**Genius:** Simply keep record of your recruiting efforts. It puts you in a good position legally and it makes giving feedback super easy. Recruiting software can really help with this stage in the process.
