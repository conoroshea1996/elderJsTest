### **Using HireHive at BearingPoint**

Having developed a new careers website and recruiting processes to meet a changing candidate market, the need for a complete, user-friendly applicant tracking system (ATS) was pressing. Having looked at a few options, HireHive proved to be the right solution:

> We viewed HireHive as an innovative tool, with a slick interface, very easy to navigate, great functionality; when you’re using a tool every day, you want to enjoy using it and have fun with it.

The ability to post open roles to the careers site, job boards and social media were also big pluses for the company. Sean’s favourite feature in HireHive is the candidate communication tool. He finds the shared inbox functionality very helpful.

### **The importance of employer branding**

Using a mix of recruitment marketing, advertising, PR, networking and events, BearingPoint adopts an integrated approach to engaging with their ideal candidates. These integrated campaigns also help BearingPoint to clearly communicate their compelling Employee Value Proposition (EVP) to their target audience. Also, they help build a strong employer brand across the business. Seán attributes his love of working in recruitment both to the industry and his employer. The company culture at BearingPoint allows for employees to have a great work/life balance.

> I love working in recruitment! I’m very lucky to work with a team of super talented people right across the organisation - we work hard and we play hard!

Furthermore, he emphasises the importance of working for a brand you are passionate about. If you don’t believe in what you’re selling, you can’t sell it. He describes employer branding as a major focus for Bearing Point:

> This is an area that has evolved hugely over the past number of years. We invest heavily in building sourcing strategies that help us to target and attract the people we identify as being a strong cultural fit for BearingPoint.

### **Candidate experience**

From the moment that candidates first engage with the brand, to the point where they are actively involved in an interview process, the team at BearingPoint do everything they can to provide a first-rate candidate recruitment experience. In fact, managing this journey is Seán’s favourite part of working in recruitment.

For unsuccessful candidates, the journey doesn’t stop there. Seán explains how BearingPoint often reconnect with candidates who were unsuccessful for one role, but may be suitable for another role. They look at a candidate’s wider skill set and see if they’re a better fit in another area. They are hiring right throughout the year and actively looking for people to join their team.
